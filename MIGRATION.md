# Migrating worca-cc

## TL;DR

| Step | Command | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| 1. Upgrade package | `pip install --upgrade worca-cc==X.Y.Z` | Updates the Python package |
| 2. Refresh runtime | `cd <project> && worca init --upgrade` | Migrates settings, copies new runtime |
| 3. Manual cleanup | See [What you must delete manually](#what-you-must-delete-manually) | Only needed for projects that pre-date v0.6.0 packaging |

## How upgrades work

1. **`pip install --upgrade worca-cc==X.Y.Z`** updates the Python package globally (or in your venv). This does not touch any project files.

2. **`worca init --upgrade`** (run inside each project) refreshes the `.claude/worca/` runtime copy and migrates settings. Run this in every project that uses worca.

3. **Manual cleanup** may be required for projects that were initially set up before the v0.6.0 packaging migration (i.e., when worca files lived directly in `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/scripts/`, etc.).

### Why manual cleanup is sometimes needed

`worca init --upgrade` includes a one-shot legacy cleanup function (`_cleanup_legacy_files` in `src/worca/cli/init.py`). However, this cleanup **only runs when `.claude/worca/__init__.py` has no `__version__` string** — meaning the project was set up via the old copy-paste method, not from a pip package.

Once a project has been upgraded to a versioned (packaged) install, the version check gate (`read_version(worca_dir) is not None`) causes the cleanup to be skipped on all subsequent upgrades. Legacy directories left behind by a previous pre-packaging install will persist silently.

## What `worca init --upgrade` handles automatically

### Settings path migrations

These old paths in `settings.json` are rewritten to their new locations:

| Old path | New path |
|----------|----------|
| `.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py` | `.claude/worca/claude_hooks/pre_tool_use.py` |
| `.claude/hooks/post_tool_use.py` | `.claude/worca/claude_hooks/post_tool_use.py` |
| `.claude/hooks/user_prompt_submit.py` | `.claude/worca/claude_hooks/user_prompt_submit.py` |
| `.claude/scripts/preflight_checks.py` | `.claude/worca/scripts/preflight_checks.py` |

Source: `_PATH_MIGRATIONS` in `src/worca/cli/init.py:108-118`.

### Settings key migrations

| Setting | Old value | New value | Context |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| `worca.stages.review.agent` | `guardian` | `reviewer` | W-037 agent rename |
| `worca.agent_overrides_dir` | `.claude/agents/overrides` | `.claude/agents` | Override dir flattening |

### Agent override directory migration

Override files are moved from `.claude/agents/overrides/*.md` to `.claude/agents/*.md` (flat). The empty `overrides/` directory is removed if no user files remain.

### Runtime copy

The entire `.claude/worca/` directory is replaced with a fresh copy from the installed package (excluding `cli/` and `__pycache__/`).

### Settings deep-merge

New default keys from the package's `src/worca/settings.json` are merged into the project's `.claude/settings.json` **non-destructively**: missing keys are added, but existing user values are preserved. This means user-chosen agent models (`worca.agents.<name>.model`), custom `permissions.allow` entries, webhooks, loop counts, and other tuned values survive `--upgrade`.

Forward-incompatible renames (e.g. `stages.review.agent: guardian -> reviewer` in W-037) are applied explicitly via `_migrate_settings_paths` *before* the merge, so they land deterministically and show up under `worca init --check`.

If you want to hard-reset your settings to the current template, use `worca init --force` (destructive). Project-specific overrides that should never be touched by any upgrade still belong in `.claude/settings.local.json`.

### Global key extraction (W-049)

Four settings keys that are naturally global (apply across all projects) are extracted from `.claude/settings.json` into `~/.worca/settings.json`:

| Key (under `worca.`) | Default | Scope after migration |
|---|---|---|
| `parallel.cleanup_policy` | `never` | Global (`~/.worca/settings.json`) |
| `parallel.max_concurrent_pipelines` | `10` | Global |
| `ui.worktree_disk_warning_bytes` | `2000000000` | Global |
| `circuit_breaker.classifier_model` | `haiku` | Global |

If `~/.worca/settings.json` does not exist, it is created. Existing values in the global file are preserved (project values merge in). After extraction, the keys are removed from the project file.

Idempotent: runs silently on second invocation.

Source: `_migrate_global_keys_to_preferences` in `src/worca/cli/init.py`.

### Inert milestone key stripping (W-049)

`pr_approval` and `deploy_approval` under `worca.milestones` are removed from `.claude/settings.json` **if and only if** their value is exactly `true` (the old template default). Any other value (`false`, a string, etc.) is left alone as an intentional user override.

Why: these keys were inert before W-049 — the runner ignored them. After W-049, the runner gates on `pr_approval is True`, so leaving the template default in place would activate the PR-creation approval gate on every upgraded project, hanging autonomous flows.

Stripping the default lets the runner's missing-key behavior (`false`) take effect, keeping the gate opt-in.

If both keys are removed and `worca.milestones` becomes empty, the empty object is cleaned up.

Idempotent: runs silently on second invocation.

Source: `_strip_inert_milestone_keys` in `src/worca/cli/init.py`.

### .gitignore entries

These entries are added if missing: `.worca/`, `logs/`, `.claude/settings.local.json`.

### Beads

- `.beads/` is initialized if it doesn't exist.
- The beads repo fingerprint is updated on upgrade (`bd migrate --update-repo-id`).

### One-shot legacy cleanup (pre-packaging installs only)

On the **first** upgrade from a pre-packaging install (no version in `.claude/worca/__init__.py`), these are automatically removed:

- `.claude/hooks/` — files: `__init__.py`, `post_tool_use.py`, `pre_compact.py`, `pre_tool_use.py`, `session_end.py`, `session_start.py`, `stop.py`, `subagent_start.py`, `subagent_stop.py`, `user_prompt_submit.py`
- `.claude/scripts/` — files: `__init__.py`, `preflight_checks.py`, `run_batch.py`, `run_learn.py`, `run_multi.py`, `run_parallel.py`, `run_pipeline.py`, `worca.py`
- `.claude/agents/core/` — files: `coordinator.md`, `guardian.md`, `implementer.md`, `learner.md`, `plan_reviewer.md`, `planner.md`, `tester.md`
- `.claude/agents/domain/` — removed if it only contains `.gitkeep` and/or `.DS_Store`
- `.claude/worca-ui/` — entire directory

## What you must delete manually

If your project was set up before v0.6.0 and has since been upgraded past the version gate, the following directories and files may still exist. **None of them are read by any current code path** — they are safe to delete.

Run `worca init --check` first as a dry-run to see what the upgrade tool would do, then use the table below to identify leftover files.

### Obsolete files inventory

| Path | Replaced by | Still read by any code? | Safe to delete |
|------|-------------|------------------------|----------------|
| `.claude/hooks/` | `.claude/worca/claude_hooks/` | No — `settings.json` points to `.claude/worca/claude_hooks/` | Yes |
| `.claude/scripts/` | `.claude/worca/scripts/` | No — `settings.json` and CLI entry points use the packaged paths | Yes |
| `.claude/worca-ui/` | `@worca/ui` npm package (install globally) or the `worca-ui/` directory in the source repo | No — the embedded UI was fully removed | Yes |
| `.claude/agents/core/*.md` | `.claude/worca/agents/core/` (runtime copy from package) | No — see explanation below | Yes |
| `.claude/agents/domain/` | Nothing (empty scaffolding leftover) | No | Yes |
| `.claude/agents/overrides/` | `.claude/agents/` (flat, no subdirectory) | No — `agent_overrides_dir` defaults to `.claude/agents` | Yes |
| `__pycache__/` dirs inside any of the above | N/A | No | Yes |

### Why `.claude/agents/core/*.md` files are dead

This is the most confusing leftover. Three different `agents/core/` paths exist:

1. **`src/worca/agents/core/`** — the canonical templates in the pip package source tree.
2. **`.claude/worca/agents/core/`** — the runtime copy created by `worca init`. This is what the pipeline reads at runtime (`runner.py:257`).
3. **`.claude/agents/core/`** — the **old** pre-packaging location. **Nothing reads from here.**

The runtime (`runner.py`) resolves agent templates from `.claude/worca/agents/core/` only. Agent overrides live flat in `.claude/agents/<agent>.md` (no `core/` subdirectory). Claude Code's subagent discovery scans `.claude/agents/` flat — it does not recurse into `core/`.

Files in `.claude/agents/core/` are neither templates nor overrides. They are inert.

### Consolidated cleanup command

After verifying with `worca init --check`, run this from your project root:

```bash
cd .claude
rm -rf hooks/ scripts/ worca-ui/ agents/domain/ agents/overrides/
rm -f agents/core/coordinator.md agents/core/guardian.md agents/core/implementer.md \
     agents/core/learner.md agents/core/plan_reviewer.md agents/core/planner.md \
     agents/core/tester.md agents/core/reviewer.md
rmdir agents/core 2>/dev/null || true
find . -name __pycache__ -type d -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null || true
```

If `.claude/agents/core/` contains files you do not recognize (not in the list above), investigate before deleting — they may be custom files you created.

## Where overrides go now

| Type | Location | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Per-project agent override | `.claude/agents/<agent>.md` | `.claude/agents/implementer.md` |
| Per-project block override | `.claude/agents/<block>.block.md` | `.claude/agents/implement.block.md` |

Override modes:

- **Replace** (default): the override file replaces the base prompt entirely. No tag needed, or use `<!-- replace -->` explicitly.
- **Append** (`<!-- append -->`): sections are merged into the base using section-level merge. Use `## Override: <Section Name>` headings to target specific sections.
- **Governance protection**: sections marked `<!-- governance -->` in the base cannot be replaced by overrides (demoted to append with a warning).

For details, see the `/worca-agent-override` skill or `src/worca/orchestrator/overlay.py`.

## Verifying the upgrade

After upgrading and cleaning up, run these checks:

```bash
# 1. Dry-run check for drift
worca init --check

# 2. Verify .claude/ directory structure
ls .claude/
# Expected: agents/  settings.json  skills/  templates/  worca/
# Optional: settings.local.json  worktrees/

# 3. Confirm runtime version matches installed package
grep __version__ .claude/worca/__init__.py
python -c "import worca; print(worca.__version__)"
# Both should print the same version

# 4. Check settings.json has no stale paths
grep -c '.claude/hooks/' .claude/settings.json    # should be 0
grep -c '.claude/scripts/' .claude/settings.json  # should be 0 (except .claude/worca/scripts/ which is correct)
```

## Version-specific notes

### 0.5.0 → 0.6.0

The packaging migration. This is the release that moved pipeline code from `.claude/` into the `src/worca/` pip package.

- Agent templates moved from `.claude/agents/core/` to `src/worca/agents/core/` (runtime copy at `.claude/worca/agents/core/`)
- Hook scripts moved from `.claude/hooks/` to `src/worca/claude_hooks/`
- Agent overrides directory simplified from `.claude/agents/overrides/` to `.claude/agents/` (flat)
- `release.yml` merged into `release-pypi.yml`
- **Manual cleanup required** for projects that pre-date this release — see [What you must delete manually](#what-you-must-delete-manually)

### 0.6.x → 0.7.0

- Usage object logging added with model-specific pricing
- `DEFAULT_PRICING` removed from UI; pricing now sourced from `settings.json`
- Beads fingerprint upgrade added to `worca init`

### 0.7.0 → 0.8.0

- Pipeline templates system added (W-016)
- No path or settings migrations required

### 0.8.0 → 0.9.0

- Template agent prompt overrides wired through overlay resolver
- `milestones.plan_approval=false` now correctly auto-approves plans
- `pipeline.pid` moved to per-run directories for concurrent pipeline support

### 0.9.0 → 0.10.0+

- W-037: Agent prompts extracted into composable block files
- `stages.review.agent` renamed from `guardian` to `reviewer` (auto-migrated by `worca init --upgrade`)

### 0.15.x → 0.16.0

W-043: Unified pipeline state model and universal event dispatch.

**Breaking changes:**

1. **Terminal state for user-stop unified to `interrupted`** — Previously, stopping a running pipeline via the UI wrote `pipeline_status: "failed"`. Now all stop paths (control-file, webhook, signal) produce `"interrupted"` with a discriminating `stop_reason` (`control_file`, `control_webhook`, `signal`, `force_cancelled`). Code that checks for `"failed"` to detect user-initiated stops must now check for `"interrupted"` instead.

2. **`POST /runs/:id/stop` rejects dead-PID with 409** — If the pipeline process is no longer alive but `pipeline_status` is still `running` or `paused`, the stop endpoint now returns `409 { code: "no_running_process", suggested_action: "cancel" }` instead of silently rewriting the status. Use the cancel endpoint to clean up dead runs.

3. **`DELETE /runs/:id` removed** — The old DELETE alias for stopping a pipeline has been removed. Use `POST /runs/:id/stop` to stop a running pipeline. A new `POST /runs/:id/delete` endpoint permanently removes a run directory (refuses if the pipeline is still running).

4. **New `pipeline.run.cancelled` event type** — Cancelling a run via `POST /runs/:id/cancel` now emits a `pipeline.run.cancelled` event through the universal dispatch pipeline (webhooks, integrations). Previously, cancel was a silent status rewrite.

5. **`resuming` pipeline status removed** — The `resuming` status is no longer emitted by any code path. Pipelines go directly from `paused` to `running` on resume. UI components no longer render a `resuming` badge. The legacy `interrupted → paused` status mapping has also been removed — `interrupted` is now a canonical terminal state.

6. **Windows stop semantics** — On Windows, `SIGTERM` does not propagate to child processes. The stop flow now kills the agent subprocess directly via `agent.pid` when `process.platform === 'win32'`.

**No automatic migrations required** — these are runtime behavior changes. Update any external integrations or scripts that depend on the old behavior.

### 0.17.x → 0.18.0

W-048: Worktree-based pipeline isolation and unified run aggregation.

**Breaking changes:**

1. **`active_run` pointer file removed** — `.worca/active_run` is no longer written by any code path. External tools or scripts that read this file will get no data. Replace with scanning `.worca/runs/*/status.json` for non-terminal runs (`pipeline_status` not in `completed`, `failed`, `interrupted`). The stale file is deleted on the next `worca init --upgrade`.

2. **`run_multi.py` and `run_batch.py` removed** — Both batch entry points are gone. Use `run_worktree.py` (one call per pipeline) or a shell loop as a replacement:
   ```bash
   # Old (run_multi.py accepted --requests)
   python .claude/worca/scripts/run_multi.py --requests req1.json req2.json
   # New
   for req in req1.json req2.json; do
     python .claude/worca/scripts/run_worktree.py --source "$req" &
   done
   ```

3. **WebSocket protocol: 5 pipeline-* message types removed** — The `MultiWatcher`-based pipeline subscription protocol has been retired. The following message types are no longer emitted or accepted by the server:
   - `list-pipelines`
   - `subscribe-pipeline`
   - `unsubscribe-pipeline`
   - `pipeline-status-changed`
   - `pipelines-list`

   **Third-party WebSocket subscribers using any of these types will break.** Migrate to the unified run subscription protocol: subscribe via `subscribe-run` (or receive `runs-list` broadcasts) which now includes worktree runs alongside root runs. The `state.pipelines` client-side map is derived from `state.runs` — no separate pipeline subscription needed.

4. **`MultiWatcher` server module removed** — `worca-ui/server/multi-watcher.js` is deleted. If any custom server code references `MultiWatcher`, `WatcherSet#getMultiWatcher`, or `WatcherSet#_createMultiWatcher`, remove those references.

5. **'Pipeline already running' block removed from new-run UI** — Starting a new run no longer fails when a pipeline is already running. Each run spawns in its own isolated git worktree, so multiple concurrent pipelines are supported. External integrations that relied on the `422 Pipeline already running` error from `POST /runs` (or the equivalent WS rejection) must remove that error-handling branch.

**New features / commands:**

- **`run_worktree.py`** — single-pipeline worktree launcher. Creates a git worktree, registers in `pipelines.d/`, and spawns `run_pipeline.py` inside the worktree. Accepts `--prompt`, `--source`, `--plan`, `--branch`, `--guide`, `--fleet-id`.
- **`--guide` flag on `run_pipeline.py`** — Pass a reference guide (repeatable) into the pipeline. Requires W-040 (`attach_guide()`) to be installed; emits a fatal error otherwise rather than silently dropping the content.
- **`worca cleanup`** — Remove completed/failed pipeline worktrees from disk and from the `pipelines.d/` registry. Running worktrees are never eligible. Options: `--all`, `--run-id`, `--dry-run`, `--older-than`.
- **`pipelines.d/` fan-out in `discoverRuns`** — Worktree runs are now visible in the unified runs list alongside root project runs. No UI changes required.

**No automatic migrations required** — these are runtime behavior and protocol changes. Run `worca init --upgrade` once to remove the stale `active_run` file from `.worca/`. Update any external integrations or scripts that depend on the removed batch scripts, WebSocket protocol types, or `active_run` file.

### 0.18.x → 0.19.0

W-049: Settings UI for execution, approval gates, circuit breaker, and worktree disk threshold.

**Default changes:**

| Setting | Old default | New default | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cleanup_policy` | `on-success` | `never` | Auto-deletion would silently break worktree inspection workflows |
| `max_concurrent_pipelines` | `3` | `10` | A cap of 3 immediately blocks users with 4+ projects |
| `pr_approval` | `true` (inert) | `false` (active) | Default-true would hang every autonomous run at the PR-creation gate |

**Project/global settings split:**

Four keys move from project-scoped (`.claude/settings.json`) to global-scoped (`~/.worca/settings.json`): `cleanup_policy`, `max_concurrent_pipelines`, `worktree_disk_warning_bytes`, `classifier_model`. The canonical list and defaults live in `src/worca/schemas/keys.json`.

**Automatic migration via `worca init --upgrade`:**

1. Global keys are extracted from the project file into `~/.worca/settings.json` (created if absent).
2. Template-default `pr_approval: true` and `deploy_approval: true` are stripped from the project file to prevent the new PR-approval gate from activating unexpectedly.

Both steps are idempotent. Run output:

```
Migrated 4 key(s) to ~/.worca/settings.json
Reset 2 template-default milestone key(s) (pr_approval, deploy_approval) — gate now opt-in via Pipeline tab
```

**If you skip `worca init --upgrade`:**

The UI's settings editor handles migration automatically. When you open project settings, a banner appears if misplaced global keys or inert milestone defaults are detected. Clicking "Migrate now" (or simply saving settings) triggers the same extraction — the server's save handler auto-migrates on every save. No data is lost; no separate endpoint or manual JSON editing is required.

**New features:**

- Settings UI panels for Execution & Parallelism, Approval Gates, and Circuit Breaker configuration.
- Global Preferences tab (`~/.worca/settings.json`) for cross-project settings (worktree cleanup, concurrency cap, disk threshold, classifier model).
- PR-approval gate: when `worca.milestones.pr_approval` is `true`, the pipeline pauses before PR creation and waits for user approval via the run-detail UI.
- Server-enforced `max_concurrent_pipelines` cap with launch mutex (returns 409 when at capacity).

### 0.19.0 → 0.24.0

Additive features only — no breaking changes. The one required user action is the Python floor bump.

**Required action:**

- **Python 3.10+** — the package floor was raised from 3.8 to 3.10. Ensure your environment matches before upgrading; the package will refuse to install on older interpreters.

**New features:**

- **`/worca-analyze` skill** — end-to-end issue triage (analysis → decisions → issue update → template recommendation → optional worktree launch). Auto-installed into `.claude/skills/worca-analyze/` by `worca init --upgrade`. See the [Issue Triage section in CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#issue-triage).
- **`worca run --worktree`** — first-class CLI flag to launch a pipeline into an isolated git worktree (parallel-safe). Mirrors the UI's "New Pipeline" path; falls back to in-place if `run_worktree.py` is missing in the project runtime. New companion flags: `--branch` (worktree base branch) and `--guide` (reference guides for the planner, repeatable, requires W-040).
- **`worca templates list --json`** — machine-readable enumeration of all resolvable templates (id, name, description, tier, tags, builtin, created_at) with project > user > built-in tier resolution applied. Used by `/worca-analyze` and external tooling.
- **Multi-host PR metadata (W-051)** — the `pr.json` schema gained `commit_sha`, `source_branch`, `target_branch`, `provider`, and `is_draft` fields. The `pr_url.py` parser detects GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, and Gitea URL patterns. UI surfaces a collapsible "PR details" subsection on the PR stage card. Webhook subscribers receive the richer `GIT_PR_CREATED` payload automatically — no breaking change to event names.
- **`investigate` template now publishes its plan as a PR (W-046)** — the PR stage is enabled in this template so investigation outputs land as reviewable PRs instead of staying local-only.
- **Coverage runner: `--include-unit-tests`** — opt-in flag on `scripts/coverage.py ci` that wraps the pytest invocation itself with `coverage run --parallel-mode` so unit-test in-process calls are measured alongside integration subprocess fragments. Default off (doubles wall time but produces accurate per-module numbers when needed).

**No automatic migration steps required** — `worca init --upgrade` handles the new skill placement and continues to be idempotent. All settings.json changes are additive.

### 0.24.x → 0.25.0

W-051: Configurable model profiles with per-model environment variables.

- **`worca.models` entries now accept an object form** `{ "id": "model-id", "env": { "KEY": "value" } }` in addition to the existing plain string. Env vars are injected into the subprocess environment when the corresponding agent stage runs. Secrets belong in `settings.local.json` (gitignored). No migration required — purely additive; existing string-form configs continue to work unchanged.

### 0.25.x → 0.28.0

W-040: Fleet runs — cross-repository fan-out of a single work-request.

**New features:**

- **`run_fleet.py`** — new entry point that fans a single work-request out to N independent project repositories in parallel. Each target gets its own isolated pipeline (own git worktree, own branch, own PR), grouped under a shared `fleet_id` in `pipelines.d/`.

  ```bash
  python .claude/scripts/run_fleet.py \
    --projects /path/to/repo-a /path/to/repo-b /path/to/repo-c \
    --prompt "Apply authentication migration"
  ```

- **`--guide PATH`** (repeatable) — attach a normative reference document (migration spec, RFC) that every child's agents treat as the highest-authority source. Paths are resolved to absolute before dispatch. Also now wired into `run_pipeline.py` and `run_parallel.py`. Combined guide content is capped at 64 KB (`worca.guide.max_bytes`).

- **`--head-template TMPL`** — per-child head branch name template. Placeholders: `{project}`, `{fleet_id}`, `{slug}`, `{yyyymmdd}`, `{yyyymmddhhmm}`. If no placeholder is present, `/{project}` is appended automatically to ensure uniqueness across the fleet.

- **`--base BRANCH`** — PR base branch shared across the fleet. When omitted, each child resolves its own default branch. `--branch` is explicitly rejected on `run_fleet.py` — use `--base` and `--head-template` instead.

- **`--plan PATH`** — shared plan file; every child receives it and skips the PLAN stage entirely (recommended for fleet work).

- **`--plan-first [PROJECT]`** — run the Planner on a reference child first; once its `MASTER_PLAN.md` appears it is copied to `~/.worca/fleet-runs/<fleet_id>/shared-plan.md` and all remaining children inherit it. Mutually exclusive with `--plan`.

- **`--max-parallel N`** — maximum concurrent child pipelines (default: 5). Children are dispatched in batches; the fleet-level circuit breaker fires between batches.

- **`--fleet-failure-threshold RATIO`** — failure ratio that trips the circuit breaker and halts unstarted children (default: 0.30). In-flight children are never killed.

- **`--resume FLEET_ID`** — resume a halted or failed fleet by re-launching only failed/pending/setup_failed children. Children that are completed, running, or paused are left alone.

- **`--init-timeout SECONDS`** — per-target `worca init --upgrade` timeout (default: 60). Targets that exceed this are marked `setup_failed` and skipped; the fleet continues.

- **`fleet_id` in `pipelines.d/`** — each child pipeline's registry entry now carries `fleet_id` and `group_type: "fleet"`. The UI reads these fields to group runs under a shared fleet header. Existing entries without `fleet_id` are unaffected.

- **Fleet manifest** — fleet-level state is tracked at `~/.worca/fleet-runs/<fleet_id>.json` (work request, guide paths, plan mode, circuit breaker status, child list). Per-child pipeline state remains in each project's `pipelines.d/` entries — not duplicated.

- **`worca cleanup --fleet-id FLEET_ID`** — remove all child worktrees, their `pipelines.d/` entries, and the fleet manifest directory (including uploaded guides) in one command.

- **Guardian PR titles** — when `fleet_id` is present the Guardian agent prepends `[fleet:<short_id>]` to every PR title, making fleet PRs easy to spot in GitHub's PR list.

**New UI surfaces:**

- **Dashboard fleet grouping** — the worca-ui dashboard groups fleet children under a collapsible fleet header showing an aggregate status badge (blue = running, orange = halted by circuit breaker, green = completed, red = failed), aggregate progress (`N/M completed · K failed`), and a link to the fleet detail view. Requires **global mode** (`pnpm worca:ui` without `--project`).

- **Fleet launcher** (`New Fleet` option in the sidebar dropdown) — form to launch a fleet from the UI: target project multi-select, prompt, guide file upload, plan mode toggle, concurrency settings.

- **Fleet detail view** — per-fleet page listing all children with their individual run status, branch, and PR link.

**New settings:**

```jsonc
"worca": {
  "guide": {
    "max_bytes": 65536          // 64 KB hard cap on combined guide content
  },
  "fleet": {
    "init_timeout_seconds": 60  // per-target worca init --upgrade timeout
  }
}
```

Both keys are additive. Existing installs pick them up as defaults on the next `worca init --upgrade`.

**No automatic migration required.** All changes are additive. Run `worca init --upgrade` once to pull the new `worca.guide.*` and `worca.fleet.*` defaults into your project's `settings.json`.

**Full walkthrough:** [`docs/fleet-runs.md`](./docs/fleet-runs.md).

### 0.28.x → 0.29.0

W-047: Multi-repo coordinated pipelines (workspace runs).

**New features:**

- **`run_workspace.py`** — new entry point that coordinates changes across interdependent repos with dependency-ordered execution. Unlike fleet runs (same prompt to N repos), workspace runs decompose one prompt into repo-specific sub-plans, execute them in DAG tier order, run cross-repo integration tests, and create linked PRs with dependency metadata.

  ```bash
  python .claude/scripts/run_workspace.py /path/to/parent \
    --prompt "Add user authentication across all services"
  ```

- **`worca workspace init`** — scaffolds a `workspace.json` from sibling git repos in a parent directory. Scans child directories for `.git/`, generates the workspace definition with defaults (`depends_on: []`, `role: "service"`), and creates the `.worca/` directory.

  ```bash
  worca workspace init /path/to/parent         # Scan child dirs, create workspace.json
  worca workspace init /path/to/parent --force  # Overwrite existing workspace.json
  ```

- **`workspace.json`** — persistent workspace definition listing repos, their roles, dependency relationships, an optional integration test command, and an optional `umbrella_repo` for the umbrella issue. Lives in the parent directory containing sibling repos.

- **Master planner** — an Opus agent that reads all repos' `CLAUDE.md` files, workspace topology, and the work request, then produces a structured workspace plan with per-repo sub-plans. Skip with `--skip-planning` to let each repo plan independently.

- **DAG executor** — replaces fleet's all-at-once parallel dispatch with tier-based dependency-ordered execution. Repos within the same tier run in parallel (up to `--max-parallel`); tiers execute sequentially. Context artifacts (diff summaries, capped at 8 KB per dependency) are injected as `--guide` files between tiers so downstream repos know what upstream changed.

- **Cross-repo integration test** — after all DAG tiers complete, runs a user-defined `integration_test.command` from `workspace.json`. Creates temporary parallel worktrees for all completed children. On failure, workspace status is set to `integration_failed` and no PRs are created. Skip with `--skip-integration`.

- **Linked PR creation** — each completed child gets a PR titled `[workspace:<ws_short>] <work_title>` with dependency comments (`Depends on: org/lib#15`, `Blocks: org/frontend#43`). An umbrella issue in `umbrella_repo` lists all PRs as a checklist in merge order.

- **`--resume WORKSPACE_ID`** — resume a failed, halted, or `integration_failed` workspace run. Completed children are skipped; failed/blocked/halted children are re-dispatched. For `integration_failed`, resume re-runs the integration test without re-dispatching children.

- **`--dry-run`** — print the DAG and exit without launching children.

- **`workspace_id` in `pipelines.d/`** — each child pipeline's registry entry carries `workspace_id` and `group_type: "workspace"`. The UI reads these fields to group runs under a shared workspace header.

- **Workspace manifest** — workspace-level state is tracked at `{workspace_root}/.worca/workspace-runs/{workspace_id}/workspace-manifest.json`. A pointer file at `~/.worca/workspace-runs/{workspace_id}.json` enables global UI discovery.

- **`worca cleanup --workspace-id WORKSPACE_ID`** — remove all child worktrees, their `pipelines.d/` entries, and the workspace run directory in one command.

- **Workspace events** — new event types emitted via the universal dispatch pipeline: `workspace.launched`, `workspace.halted`, `workspace.completed`, `workspace.failed`, `workspace.tier.started`, `workspace.tier.completed`, `workspace.guide_conflict`. Webhook subscribers receive these automatically.

**New workspace status values:**

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `planning` | Master planner is running |
| `running` | DAG tier execution in progress |
| `integration_testing` | All children completed; integration test running |
| `completed` | All children + integration passed; PRs created |
| `failed` | Tier failure — at least one child failed |
| `integration_failed` | Children completed but integration test failed; no PRs created |
| `halted` | User halted or circuit breaker tripped |
| `blocked` | Per-child status — a dependency failed |

**New status enums:**

`PipelineStatus`, `FleetStatus`, and `WorkspaceStatus` enums added to `src/worca/state/status.py`. All status read sites migrate to enum-based checks in this release.

**New CLI flags on `run_workspace.py`:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `WORKSPACE_ROOT` | Positional: path to parent directory containing `workspace.json` |
| `--prompt TEXT` | Work-request prompt (mutually exclusive with `--source`) |
| `--source REF` | Source reference (`gh:issue:42`, `bd:bd-abc`) |
| `--guide PATH` | Normative reference guide (repeatable) |
| `--branch TEMPLATE` | Branch name template with `{workspace}`, `{repo}`, `{slug}` placeholders |
| `--skip-integration` | Skip the cross-repo integration test phase |
| `--skip-planning` | Skip the master planner; each repo plans independently |
| `--resume WORKSPACE_ID` | Resume a failed/halted workspace run |
| `--max-parallel N` | Max concurrent children within a tier (default: 5) |
| `--dry-run` | Print the DAG and exit |

**New UI surfaces:**

- **Dashboard workspace grouping** — the worca-ui dashboard groups workspace children under a collapsible workspace header showing an aggregate status badge, DAG progress by tier, and a link to the workspace detail view. Requires **global mode** (`pnpm worca:ui` without `--project`).

- **Workspace detail view** — per-workspace page showing DAG visualization, master plan, per-repo status cards, context artifacts, integration test log, PR table with dependency links, and lifecycle actions (Halt / Pause / Stop / Resume / Cleanup).

- **Workspace launcher** — form to create and launch a workspace run from the UI: workspace root selection, prompt, guide upload, planning/integration toggles.

- **WebSocket events** — `workspace-update`, `workspace-tier-update`, and `guide-conflict` message types added to `protocol.js` allowlist.

**New settings:**

```jsonc
"worca": {
  "workspace": {
    "init_timeout_seconds": 60,      // per-target worca init --upgrade timeout
    "max_parallel": 5,               // max concurrent children within a tier
    "context_cap_bytes": 8192,       // 8 KB cap on inter-tier context artifacts
    "failure_threshold": 0.30        // circuit breaker failure ratio
  }
}
```

All keys under `worca.workspace` are additive. Existing installs pick them up as defaults on the next `worca init --upgrade`.

**No automatic migration required.** All changes are additive — no breaking changes, no settings path migrations, no removed commands. Run `worca init --upgrade` once to pull the new `worca.workspace.*` defaults into your project's `settings.json`.

### 0.29.x → 0.33.0+

W-054: Configurable per-agent tool/skill/subagent dispatch governance.

**Breaking changes:**

1. **`governance.subagent_dispatch` replaced by `governance.dispatch`** — The flat `worca.governance.subagent_dispatch` key is replaced by a nested `worca.governance.dispatch` object with three sections (`tools`, `skills`, `subagents`), each carrying `always_disallowed`, `default_denied`, and `per_agent_allow` tiers. Existing per-agent subagent allow lists are preserved verbatim under `governance.dispatch.subagents.per_agent_allow`.

2. **`Skill` tool unblocked** — The `Skill` tool is no longer in the hardcoded `--disallowedTools` list. A new `skill_use.py` PreToolUse hook gates every skill invocation through the `governance.dispatch.skills` section. Skills matching `always_disallowed` patterns (pipeline-recursion, governance self-modification) are blocked unconditionally. Skills in `default_denied` require explicit opt-in via `per_agent_allow`.

3. **`--disallowedTools` is now settings-driven** — The tool disallow list is resolved from `governance.dispatch.tools.always_disallowed` instead of being hardcoded. The default list (`EnterPlanMode`, `EnterWorktree`, `TodoWrite`) matches the previous behavior.

4. **`pipeline.hook.dispatch_allowed` event gains `via` field** — Telemetry events for dispatch decisions now include `via: "wildcard" | "explicit"`. Downstream consumers that validate event schemas strictly may need to accept the new field.

5. **UI subagent dispatch card replaced** — The single-section subagent dispatch editor in the Governance settings panel is replaced with a three-section editor (Tools, Skills, Subagents). Bookmarks or screenshots of the old layout are stale.

6. **Dispatch telemetry events unified (PR D)** — The two event-name conventions (`pipeline.hook.dispatch_*` for subagents, `pipeline.hook.skill_*` for skills) collapse into a single `pipeline.hook.dispatch_{allowed,blocked}` family. The payload now carries `section` (`"subagents"` or `"skills"`) and `candidate` instead of the section-specific `subagent_type` / `skill` keys.

   ```jsonc
   // OLD (skills)
   { "event_type": "pipeline.hook.skill_allowed",
     "payload": { "agent": "implementer", "skill": "review", "via": "wildcard" } }

   // NEW (both sections)
   { "event_type": "pipeline.hook.dispatch_allowed",
     "payload": { "agent": "implementer", "section": "skills",
                  "candidate": "review", "via": "wildcard" } }
   ```

   Downstream event consumers (webhooks, log scrapers) that filter by `event_type` or read `payload.subagent_type` / `payload.skill` need to read `payload.candidate` and discriminate by `payload.section`. The pre-PR-D `skill_*` event types are no longer emitted by `skill_use.py`. The UI aggregator drops the `payload.subagent_type || payload.skill` fallback and reads `payload.candidate` exclusively; it ignores legacy `skill_*` events that may linger in old event logs.

**Automatic migration via `worca init --upgrade`:**

```
governance.subagent_dispatch -> governance.dispatch.subagents (W-054 — tools and skills sections added with defaults)
```

The migration:
- Moves all per-agent entries from `governance.subagent_dispatch` into `governance.dispatch.subagents.per_agent_allow`
- Seeds `_defaults` from the bundled defaults (`["Explore"]`) if not already present
- Seeds `always_disallowed` and `default_denied` for the subagents section from bundled defaults
- Adds `tools` and `skills` sections with their full default configuration
- Removes the legacy `governance._dispatch_legacy` key if present
- Is idempotent — re-running on already-migrated settings is a no-op

**If you skip `worca init --upgrade`:**

The UI's settings save handler runs the same migration automatically. The next time you save settings through the Governance panel, the old shape is migrated in place.

**New reference:** [`docs/governance.md`](./docs/governance.md) — full reference for the three-tier dispatch model.

### 0.33.x → 0.35.0

W-052: Adaptive effort levels for pipeline agents.

**Behavior change (no breaking API changes):**

1. **New default `auto_mode=adaptive`** — Pipelines that previously ran every agent at Claude Code's model default effort now receive explicit per-agent effort values (`planner: xhigh`, `coordinator: medium`, `guardian: high`) and adaptive loopback escalation. The coordinator classifies each bead's complexity via `worca-effort:<level>` labels, and the implementer consumes those labels as its starting effort.

   **One-line opt-out** to restore pre-W-052 behavior (all agents at model default, no escalation):

   ```jsonc
   // .claude/settings.json
   { "worca": { "effort": { "auto_mode": "disabled" } } }
   ```

2. **Shipped models lack `xhigh`** — The default `worca.models` aliases resolve to **Opus 4.6** and **Sonnet 4.6**, whose effort ladders are `low / medium / high / max` (no `xhigh`). The shipped defaults `planner: xhigh` and `auto_cap: xhigh` are collapsed by model-aware resolution:
   - `planner: xhigh` runs as `high` on Opus 4.6 (base rounds down to the highest supported rung). `status.json` records `level: "high"`, `requested: "xhigh"` so the UI shows the policy-vs-actual divergence.
   - `auto_cap: xhigh` rounds *up* to `max` on 4-rung models, so the cap does not block loopback escalation.

3. **Aggressive escalation on 4-rung ladders** — On the shipped models, a single loopback takes a `high`-base implementer straight to `max` because the ladder has no `xhigh` rung between them:

   ```
   Sonnet 4.6 ladder: low(0) → medium(1) → high(2) → max(3)
                                            ^^^^        ^^^^
                                            base      base + 1 (test_failure)
   ```

   The default `auto_cap: xhigh` permits this (rounds up to `max`). This relaxes the "`max` only via explicit opt-in" guarantee to "explicit opt-in **or** loopback escalation on a model lacking `xhigh`."

   **To prevent auto-escalation to `max`**, pin `auto_cap: high`:

   ```jsonc
   { "worca": { "effort": { "auto_cap": "high" } } }
   ```

   This creates a deliberate dead-zone: escalation clamps at `high` with `capped_from: "max"` recorded in the iteration.

4. **Restoring the full 5-rung ladder** — Point `worca.models.opus` at Opus 4.7 to get all five rungs (`low / medium / high / xhigh / max`). Escalation becomes gentler: `high + test_failure = xhigh` (not `max`), and `auto_cap: xhigh` is an actual ceiling below `max`.

   ```jsonc
   { "worca": { "models": { "opus": "claude-opus-4-7-20250219" } } }
   ```

**New settings (additive):**

```jsonc
"worca": {
  "effort": {
    "auto_mode": "adaptive",   // disabled | reactive | adaptive
    "auto_cap": "xhigh"        // low | medium | high | xhigh | max
  }
}
```

Per-agent effort values (`worca.agents.<agent>.effort`) accept `low | medium | high | xhigh | max`. Omitted = mode-dependent fallback (model default or bead label).

**No automatic migration required.** The new `worca.effort` block is additive — `worca init --upgrade` merges the defaults into your project's `settings.json` non-destructively. Existing per-agent `model` and `max_turns` values are preserved.

**Full reference:** [`docs/effort.md`](./docs/effort.md).

### 0.34.x → 0.35.0

W-054 follow-up: dispatch defaults self-heal on upgrade, and the `worca-*` skills denylist is narrowed.

**Behavior changes (no config edits required):**

1. **Stale Explore-only subagent default is auto-adopted to the new wildcard default.** W-054 preserved each project's existing per-agent subagent allow lists verbatim. Projects that were on the *old shipped default* — every pipeline agent capped to `["Explore"]`, from the W-038 era — were therefore left pinned to Explore-only even though the W-054 default had become `_defaults: ["*"]` (any subagent except `general-purpose`). On upgrade, a config whose `governance.dispatch.subagents.per_agent_allow` exactly matches that legacy Explore-only set is collapsed to `{ "_defaults": ["*"] }`, so pipeline agents (planner, implementer, tester, …) can dispatch any subagent again. **Customized configs are not touched** — the match is exact, and a touched `_defaults` (or any added/changed entry) preserves your settings as-is.

2. **The broad `worca-*` skills denylist glob is narrowed.** `governance.dispatch.skills.always_disallowed` previously hard-denied *every* `worca-*` skill via a glob. It now names only the genuinely-dangerous ones individually (`worca-release`, `worca-rc`, `worca-pr-prep`, `worca-install`, `worca-sync`, `worca-sync-commit`, `worca-sync-pr`, `worca-agent-override`, `worca-analyze`, `worca-plan-new`). Useful dev skills (`worca-dev-precommit`, `worca-coverage`, `worca-ui-add-*`, `worca-event-add`, `worca-webhook-test`, `worca-issue`) become dispatchable via the per-agent `"*"` wildcard. As above, this only rewrites an *untouched* denylist (exact set match); a customized denylist is preserved.

**One-time and version-stamped.** Both normalizations are gated by a new `governance.dispatch_migration_version` integer (current value `1`). They run exactly once per config — on `worca init --upgrade` (Python) or on the next Governance-panel save (UI) — then the stamp prevents them from running again, so deliberately re-pinning agents to Explore-only *after* the upgrade sticks.

**To keep the old (restrictive) behavior**, set the per-agent subagent entries (and/or the skills denylist) explicitly to your preferred values. Because the stamp is written on first upgrade, your explicit choices are never re-widened.

**Automatic migration messages via `worca init --upgrade`:**

```
governance.dispatch.subagents: adopted new default (_defaults: ["*"]) for config pinned to legacy Explore-only set
governance.dispatch.skills.always_disallowed: narrowed legacy "worca-*" glob to the current must-disallow set
```

### 0.35.x → 0.36.0

W-053: Optional Graphify knowledge-graph integration (query-based agent consumption).

**New feature — opt-in, off by default.** When `worca.graphify.enabled` is `true` (project-level), the Preflight stage builds a per-commit code knowledge graph (`graphify update`, content-addressed under `$WORCA_CACHE/ast/<repo-id>/<sha>/graphify/`) and pipeline agents query it on demand. With graphify disabled, pipeline behavior is byte-identical to before.

**How agents consume it:**

- Agents do **not** receive `GRAPH_REPORT.md` injected into their prompts. When a `ready` graph exists, the runner exports `GRAPHIFY_OUT=<snapshot>/graphify` into every agent subprocess, so a bare `graphify query "<question>"` reads the cached `graph.json`. Each stage prompt carries only a one-line availability note; the how-to-use guidance lives in each agent's core `.md` (`## Knowledge graph (advisory)`).
- **Read-only guard:** the `pre_tool_use` hook blocks mutating graphify subcommands (`update`, `install`, `add`, …) and allows reads (`query`, `explain`, `path`, `affected`, `diagnose`). The pipeline owns graph builds.
- `GRAPH_REPORT.md` is cached for humans only (surfaced in the UI Graphify tab with a copy-able query snippet).

**Required tooling (only if you enable graphify):**

- `uv tool install 'graphifyy>=0.8.16,<1'` — the PyPI package is `graphifyy` (double-y); the CLI it installs is `graphify`. Prefer `uv`/`pipx` over plain `pip` so the CLI lands on PATH. Worca pins `>=0.8.16` for the `update` command + `GRAPHIFY_OUT`-honoring reads.

**New settings (additive):**

```jsonc
"worca": {
  "graphify": {
    "enabled": false,        // project-level opt-in
    "mode": "structural"     // structural (fully local) | full (LLM semantic pass)
  },
  "governance": {
    "guards": {
      "block_graphify_mutation": true   // block agent-issued `graphify update/install/...`
    }
  }
}
```

**No automatic migration required.** All changes are additive — `worca init --upgrade` merges the new defaults non-destructively. Graphify stays off unless a project sets `worca.graphify.enabled: true`.

**Full reference:** [`docs/plans/W-053-graphify-integration.md`](./docs/plans/W-053-graphify-integration.md).

### 0.40.x → 0.41.0

`general-purpose` subagent moves from `always_disallowed` to `default_denied` — still off by default, but now allowable per-agent.

**Why:** the `general-purpose` subagent (which spawns an unconstrained, full-tool Claude session) was on `subagents.always_disallowed`. The resolver checks `always_disallowed` *before* `per_agent_allow`, so there was **no way to opt an agent in** — even naming `general-purpose` explicitly in a per-agent allow list (or the UI editor) was silently overruled. Moving it to `default_denied` keeps it blocked under the `"*"` wildcard (default behavior is unchanged — it stays denied) while making the per-agent opt-in path actually work.

**Behavior change (no config edits required):** on upgrade, a config whose `governance.dispatch.subagents.always_disallowed` is *exactly* `["general-purpose"]` (the untouched default) is rewritten to `always_disallowed: []` + `default_denied: ["general-purpose"]` (any pre-existing `default_denied` entries are preserved). A **customized denylist** (extra entries) is left untouched. The UI Governance editor no longer hard-blocks typing `general-purpose` into an allow list.

**One-time and version-stamped.** This is the **v2** dispatch normalization, gated by `governance.dispatch_migration_version` (bumped `1 → 2`). It runs exactly once per config — on `worca init --upgrade` (Python) or the next Governance-panel save (UI) — then the stamp prevents re-runs.

**To re-allow `general-purpose` for an agent** after upgrading, name it in `per_agent_allow` (the mixed form keeps the wildcard for everything else):

```jsonc
"subagents": {
  "default_denied": ["general-purpose"],
  "per_agent_allow": {
    "_defaults": ["*"],
    "implementer": ["*", "general-purpose"]
  }
}
```

**To forbid it everywhere** (no per-agent opt-in possible), add it back to `always_disallowed`.

**Automatic migration message via `worca init --upgrade`:**

```
governance.dispatch.subagents: moved general-purpose from always_disallowed to default_denied (now allowable per-agent)
```

**Full reference:** [`docs/governance.md`](./docs/governance.md) § Subagents.

### 0.42.x → 0.43.0

W-057: Optional code-review-graph (CRG) MCP integration (Tree-sitter AST graph, tool-based agent consumption).

**New feature — opt-in, off by default.** When `worca.code_review_graph.enabled` is `true` (project-level), the Preflight stage builds a per-commit code graph and exposes it to pipeline agents through a per-agent **MCP server** (`code-review-graph serve`). With CRG disabled, pipeline behavior is byte-identical to before. CRG and Graphify (W-053) are independent — either, both, or neither may be enabled.

**How agents consume it:**

- Agents query the graph through **MCP tools** (`mcp__code-review-graph__*` — e.g. `get_architecture_overview`, `get_minimal_context`, `query_graph`), not a Bash CLI and not an injected report. The runner starts a stdio MCP server per agent subprocess via `--mcp-config`; a per-stage `stage_tools` filter narrows which tools each role sees. Each stage prompt carries a one-line availability note; the how-to-use guidance lives in each agent's core `.md` (`## Code graph (use for orientation)`).
- **Read-only guard:** the `pre_tool_use` hook blocks mutating `code-review-graph` CLI verbs (`build`, `update`, `install`, `serve`, …) — agents may only read via MCP tools. The pipeline owns all graph builds. Gated by `worca.governance.guards.block_crg_mutation` (default `true`).
- The graph is content-addressed under `$WORCA_CACHE/ast/<repo-id>/<sha>/` (same cache model as Graphify: clean commit → `<sha>/`, dirty tree → throwaway `<sha>.dirty/`). Nothing is written into the repo tree.

**Required tooling (only if you enable CRG):**

- `pip install 'code-review-graph>=2,<3' 'fastmcp>=3.2.4'` — the `code-review-graph` CLI plus its `fastmcp` runtime dependency (a separate hard floor). The UI Code Review Graph settings tab surfaces this exact command and a re-check button.

**New settings (additive):**

```jsonc
"worca": {
  "code_review_graph": {
    "enabled": false,            // project-level opt-in
    "embeddings": false,         // semantic embeddings pass (extra cost)
    "freshness": "clean_only",   // only build on a clean tree; dirty -> throwaway
    "min_repo_files": 100,       // skip tiny repos
    "version_range": ">=2,<3",
    "fastmcp_min": "3.2.4",
    "stage_tools": null          // per-stage MCP tool filter (null = role defaults)
  },
  "governance": {
    "guards": {
      "block_crg_mutation": true // block agent-issued code-review-graph build/serve/...
    }
  }
}
```

**UI:** the run-detail Preflight stage shows a **Code Review Graph** status pill (cached / rebuilt / built (uncommitted) / skipped / unavailable / off), and each agent iteration shows a Code Review Graph invocation badge with a per-tool breakdown tooltip on hover.

**No automatic migration required.** All changes are additive — `worca init --upgrade` merges the new defaults non-destructively. CRG stays off unless a project sets `worca.code_review_graph.enabled: true`.

**Full reference:** [`docs/plans/W-057-code-review-graph-integration.md`](./docs/plans/W-057-code-review-graph-integration.md).

### 0.43.x → 0.44.0

**Bundle export/import scoped to referenced model aliases + per-alias collision UX.**

- `worca templates export --include-models / --include-pricing` now drops `worca.models` and `worca.pricing.models` entries that the exported templates don't actually reference (via `config.agents.*.model`). Previously the entire blocks were copied verbatim, so a one-template export shipped every alias in your `settings.json`.
- `worca templates import` applies the same filter against the bundled templates that landed, and additionally detects per-alias collisions against the target's current `settings.worca.models` and `pricing.models`. Different-value collisions surface a warning and prompt `[r]eplace / [s]kip / [a]bort`; `--non-interactive` defaults to skip (preserve target's values). Same-value entries are no-ops.
- Top-level pricing keys (`server_tools`, `currency`, `last_updated`) still pass through because they're project-wide context, not alias-specific.
- The `id` field on a model entry is **not** treated as a recursive alias reference — it's the literal string passed to `claude --model`. So `models["glm-ds"] = {"id": "opus", ...}` does not pull `models["opus"]` into the bundle.
- `worca-template` skill interview is split into two `AskUserQuestion` batches and the previous 5-option "stages to toggle" question is split into core (Test / Code review / PR creation) + advanced governance (Plan review / Learn) — single-batch form hit the 4-question / 4-option caps and failed with `Invalid tool parameters`.

No automatic migration required. Re-exporting old bundles will produce smaller, scope-correct bundles.

---

W-059: Plan review `review_and_edit` mode — optional in-place plan editing by the reviewer.

**New feature — opt-in, off by default.** When `worca.stages.plan_review.mode` is set to `"review_and_edit"`, the Plan Reviewer rewrites the plan in place to resolve critical/major issues and self-approves, skipping the loopback to the Planner. Default behavior (`mode: "review"`) is unchanged. Plan review itself remains disabled by default (`worca.stages.plan_review.enabled: false`).

**New settings (additive):**

```jsonc
"worca": {
  "stages": {
    "plan_review": {
      "mode": "review"           // "review" (default) | "review_and_edit"
    }
  },
  "governance": {
    "plan_review_enforce": "auto"  // "auto" | "review" | "review_and_edit"
  }
}
```

- `mode` selects the review behavior per pipeline/template.
- `plan_review_enforce` is a project-level governance override — when not `auto`, it forces the specified mode across all pipelines regardless of template.

**New event:** `pipeline.plan_review.edited` (`PLAN_EDITED`) — emitted when the reviewer edits the plan in `review_and_edit` mode. Payload includes issue severity counts and the path to the preserved original plan file.

**New template:** `feature-fast` — mirrors `feature` but enables `review_and_edit` mode for faster plan review cycles.

**No automatic migration required.** All changes are additive. Run `worca init --upgrade` once to pull the new defaults into your project's `settings.json`.

### 0.44.x → 0.45.0

- **Cost override for alt-endpoint aliases.** Model aliases that route Claude CLI through a non-Anthropic endpoint (i.e., the alias's `env` block in `worca.models` sets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) now have their run cost computed from your `worca.pricing.models.<alias>` entry instead of from Claude CLI's built-in Anthropic pricing — Claude CLI's number is wrong against a non-Anthropic endpoint. If no matching pricing entry exists, cost is recorded as $0 with a one-time stderr warning prompting you to add one.
- **Vanilla installs are unchanged.** The built-in `opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku` shorthands (and any user rename that doesn't set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) continue to use Claude CLI's authoritative `total_cost_usd`. The Pricing tab numbers for these rows remain a fallback for interrupted runs and a reference for forecasting — they do not override live cost.
- **`status.json` schema (additive).** Runs that use an alt-endpoint alias now carry `token_usage.model_alias` and `token_usage.cost_source: "alias"`. Absence of these fields means Claude CLI was authoritative — backward-compatible with existing consumers.
- **`worca templates import` works across filesystems again.** Imports previously failed with `OSError: Cross-device link` whenever the system tempdir was on a different filesystem from the repo (macOS `/private/var/folders/...` vs `/Volumes/X`, Linux tmpfs `/tmp` vs ext4 on `/home`, Windows `C:\…\Temp` vs a secondary `D:\` drive) because `settings.json` was staged in the system tempdir and atomically renamed via `os.replace`, which fails with EXDEV across filesystems. The staging file now lives next to the target on all three platforms, so the `TMPDIR=<inside-repo>` workaround is no longer needed.

### 0.45.x → 0.46.0

- **Template tier resolution swapped to `project > user > built-in`** (was `user > project > built-in`). The natural mental model — "this project pins the template, my personal copy is a fallback" — now matches the code. **Behavior change only fires on ID collisions between a project and a user template of the same name**: previously the user template silently won; now the project template wins. If you relied on a user-tier template named the same as a `.claude/templates/` entry to shadow it, rename the project entry (or delete it) to restore the prior outcome. Built-in resolution is unchanged — either tier still shadows built-ins of the same id. `worca templates list --json` reflects the new order so downstream tooling (`/worca-analyze`, `/worca-template`) sees the same winner the runtime will use.
- **Template-driven pipelines (Phase 1).** When a template is in play at run launch — either picked explicitly (`--template` / `POST /runs` body) or pinned via the new `worca.default_template` field — these keys are stripped from the project-Settings merge base before the template's `config` applies: `worca.agents`, `worca.stages`, `worca.loops`, `worca.circuit_breaker`, `worca.effort`, `worca.governance.dispatch`. The selected template owns them outright. Cross-template keys — `worca.models`, `worca.webhooks`, `worca.pricing`, `worca.governance.guards`, `worca.graphify`, `worca.code_review_graph`, `worca.default_template` itself, preflight check definitions — continue to apply as before. Rationale: a shared template now behaves identically across machines until explicitly edited; project Settings can't silently drift the template at one developer's machine.
- **Auto-migration on `worca init --upgrade`.** If your project's `.claude/settings.json` carries customized values for any of the template-owned keys above AND `worca.default_template` is not set, the upgrade snapshots those values into an auto-generated project template `.claude/templates/_legacy-settings/template.json` (`auto_generated: true`, `tags: ["auto-migrated"]`), commits, and sets `worca.default_template = "_legacy-settings"`. **Result: zero behavior change on existing projects** — your customized values keep applying via the new default-template path. Idempotent (skipped if `default_template` is already set) and collision-safe (renames to `_legacy-settings-<unix-ts>` if a user-authored template of that name already exists). To revert at any time, delete the auto-template and clear `worca.default_template` from settings.json — Settings then resume their old role for any run that doesn't pick a template.
- **New Settings → Pipeline / Agents / Effort / Governance.dispatch banner.** Each template-driven tab in the dashboard now carries a neutral banner: "Template-driven settings. When a pipeline template is in play at run launch — either picked explicitly or pinned via `worca.default_template` — these values are not applied. The selected template owns them." Links to the [precedence reference](https://docs.worca.dev/configuration/precedence/). Full Pipelines editor is tracked under [W-062](https://github.com/SinishaDjukic/worca-cc/issues/265).
- **`worca.milestones` is now template-owned.** Approval gates (`plan_approval`, `pr_approval`, `deploy_approval`) join the strip set, so a teammate's Settings can't silently flip your gates when picking the same template. Every built-in explicitly declares its gate posture: `feature` / `feature-fast` / `refactor` keep `plan_approval: true`; the autonomous flows (`bugfix` / `feature-minor` / `quick-fix` / `investigate` / `test-only`) declare all three gates `false`.
- **Built-in templates enriched for completeness.** Every built-in (`bugfix` / `feature` / `feature-fast` / `feature-minor` / `quick-fix` / `investigate` / `refactor` / `test-only`) now declares every template-owned block (effort, agents, loops, circuit_breaker, stages-minus-preflight, milestones) explicitly — sparse built-ins previously fell through to orchestrator code defaults under the strip semantics. `governance.dispatch` is the one exception (built-ins still rely on the runtime `_DISPATCH_DEFAULTS`); a regression test in `tests/test_builtin_templates.py` catches any future built-in that ships sparse.
- **`stages.preflight` cross-template carve-out.** Even though `stages` is template-owned, `stages.preflight` is preserved across the strip — templates can still deep-merge over it (e.g. a template could explicitly opt out of preflight), but if a template doesn't touch preflight, your project's preflight check definitions keep flowing through. Codified in `CROSS_TEMPLATE_CARVEOUTS` in `src/worca/orchestrator/templates.py`.
- **Pipeline Template dropdown relabel** (worca-ui). The launcher's "Project Default (settings.json)" option now reflects what will actually run: when `worca.default_template` is set, it reads `★ Default template: <name>`; when the pinned id can't be resolved, `★ Default template: <id> (missing)`; when unset, the honest `No template (raw settings.json)`.

### 0.46.x → 0.47.0

- **Pipeline editor UI** (W-062). A new top-level **Pipelines** section in worca-ui provides full CRUD over project and user templates — create, edit, duplicate, delete, validate, set-as-default — backed by `worca-ui/server/templates-routes.js`. The Settings → Pipeline "Template-driven" sub-panel now deep-links into this editor.
- **`GET /api/projects/:id/templates` response shape changed.** The list endpoint now deduplicates templates by id (project > user > built-in, matching `TemplateResolver.list()`) and returns two new fields per entry: `effectiveTier` (the tier that actually applies) and `shadows` (array of lower-priority tiers hidden by the winner, e.g. `["user", "builtin"]`). Previously the endpoint returned one entry per tier per id with no dedup, so the same template could appear up to three times. **External tooling that consumes this endpoint** should update to use `effectiveTier` instead of `tier` and handle the deduplicated shape. The old per-tier `tier` field is removed.

### 0.47.0 → 0.48.0

- **Context-window consumption surfaced per iteration** (#272). The runtime now tracks the last assistant turn's `message.usage` in `process_stream()` and computes `context_final_pct` (input + cache_read + cache_creation tokens, divided by `modelUsage[model].contextWindow`). The Iteration view in worca-ui renders `Context: NN%` next to the agent meta strip when known. Alt-endpoint runs suppress the metric (no reliable context-window denominator). `cost_stage_total_payload` schema gains an optional `context_final_pct` field; `schema_version` bumped accordingly. Subscribers that consume the payload should be additive — the field is optional and absent for alt-endpoint stages.
- **Template editor round-trip fixes** (#273). Four silent value-mishandling bugs in the W-062 Pipeline editor are fixed:
  - `config.effort` (`auto_mode` / `auto_cap`) is now seeded from the template instead of falling back to `adaptive / xhigh`. Previously, opening a template with `auto_mode: disabled` showed `adaptive` in the Agents tab and any casual edit overwrote disk back to the default.
  - `config.governance.guards` (cross-template hook gates) is no longer captured into the template on save. Templates saved with the previous editor may have absorbed the project's `guards` snapshot — re-opening and re-saving on this release returns them to "project-owned" cleanly.
  - `config.governance.dispatch` no longer silently widens to include the project's per-agent allowlists. Each dispatch section (tools / skills / subagents) now carries a dirty flag — untouched sections write the template-original; only edited sections write the merged view.
  - Per-agent fields beyond `model / max_turns / effort` survive round-trip via an `_original` overlay; no current built-in uses extra keys, but future additions won't silently drop.
- **Editor UI polish.** The Governance tab's "Plan review enforcement" section drops its redundant `ENFORCE MODE` field label (an `aria-label` on the `<sl-select>` replaces it for screen readers). The Iteration view's Effort row absorbs the Bead chip inline; the chip is suppressed when the bead label matches the effort level, when `auto_mode: disabled` made the label irrelevant, or when it was applied as-is. The common case (`fast` template with `auto_mode: disabled`) now renders one compact row instead of two near-identical ones.
- No config / settings.json migration required — `worca init --upgrade` is sufficient.

### 0.48.x → 0.49.0

W-065: Deferrable PR creation with manual promote-from-UI.

- **New `worca.stages.pr.defer` toggle (default `false`).** When `true`, the guardian stage composes the PR title/body/base and stashes them in `status.json` (`pr_deferred: true` plus `stages.pr.{pr_title,pr_body,base_branch,source_branch}`) instead of opening a PR. Promote it later with `worca pr create <run-id>` or the **Create PR** button on the run-detail PR section. Default-off means existing projects are unaffected. This is a **template-owned** key (it lives under `worca.stages`), so a template in play at run launch owns it — set it in the template's `config`, not project Settings, when a default template is pinned.
- **The config toggle and the workspace `WORCA_DEFER_PR=1` env var compose monotonically** — either can defer, neither can un-defer. Workspace child runs continue to defer to the parent DAG executor exactly as before.
- **Caution — `pr-deferred.json` schema is stricter (upgrade-ordering hazard for custom guardians).** On `outcome: success` the deferred PR schema now *requires* `pr_title`, `pr_body`, and `base_branch` (previously only `deferred` + `commit_sha`). This schema gates **every workspace child run** (they always set `WORCA_DEFER_PR=1`). The shipped `guardian.md` was restructured to emit those three fields, so a consistent install is fine — but a project with a **custom/pinned `.claude/agents/guardian.md` override** (or a stale `.claude/worca/` runtime copy) that predates W-065 will keep emitting the old deferred shape, which the new schema rejects → the guardian stage fails on workspace/deferred runs that worked before. **Fix: run `worca init --upgrade`** to refresh the runtime schema *and* re-derive the guardian prompt; if you maintain a guardian override, add `pr_title`/`pr_body`/`base_branch` to its deferred-branch structured output. Non-deferred runs use the unchanged `pr.json` schema and are unaffected.
- **`status.json` schema (additive).** Deferred runs gain a top-level `pr_deferred: true`, the stashed `stages.pr.*` fields above, and a `pr_creation` block (`state: in_progress|done|failed`, timestamps, `pr_url`/`error`) written by `worca pr create`. Absence of these fields means a normal (non-deferred) run — backward-compatible with existing consumers.
- **New `pipeline.git.pr_deferred` event** (Tier 1, chat-rendered, `warning` severity) fires when a deferred run reaches done. Additive — subscribers that don't recognize it simply ignore it; the pipeline outbound constant count moves 56 → 57.
- No automatic settings.json migration required beyond `worca init --upgrade` (which refreshes the schema + guardian prompt as noted above).
