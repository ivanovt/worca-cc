description: Browse, create, edit, and route model aliases from the dashboard — across project, user, and built-in tiers.

The **Models** page lives under **Project Configuration** in the sidebar, next to **Pipeline Templates**. From it you can browse every model alias across all three tiers, edit a model's id, env, and pricing in one place, and see which templates reference it — without touching the CLI or editing `settings.json` by hand.

:::note[Project-scoped]
The Models page is hidden in global all-projects mode until you select a project. Pick a project in the sidebar (or launch worca-ui with `--project /path`) and **Models** appears under **Project Configuration**.

## What a model alias actually is

Agents are configured by **alias**, not by raw model id. The shipped aliases — `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku` — let you swap the underlying model for every agent that references the alias by editing one place. An alias resolves to:

- a **model id** (e.g. `claude-opus-4-7`, or whatever identifier an alt-endpoint accepts), and
- an optional **env** block — environment variables that get merged into the Claude CLI subprocess when this alias runs.

The env block is the seam for routing through an alternate endpoint (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`), tuning per-model output limits, or carrying any other variable the model needs to behave correctly.

## The three tiers

The list view splits aliases into three sections by where they live on disk:

| Section | Default state | Where it lives | Who can see it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Project** | Open | `.claude/settings.json` (committed) + `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored). | Anyone with the repo. |
| **User** | Collapsed | `~/.worca/settings.json` + `~/.worca/settings.local.json`. | Only you. |
| **Built-in** | Collapsed | Ship with worca-cc — `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`. Read-only. | Everyone. |

Each section shows a count badge. Cards are clickable: click anywhere on a card to open the editor (read-only for built-ins). The card surfaces an **alt-endpoint** badge when the env block sets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, and a **"Not configured"** danger badge when any env value is still a `<YOUR-SECRET-HERE>` placeholder (typically right after a bundle import).

## Cross-tier resolution: whole-entry replace

When an alias is defined in multiple tiers, **Project replaces User replaces Built-in in entirety**. There is no field-level merge across tiers — a project-tier `glm-ds` entry shadows a user-tier `glm-ds` entry completely, including its env block and pricing.

Within a single tier the id (in `settings.json`) and env (in `settings.local.json`) still compose — they're the same logical entry, split across the committed and gitignored files for secret hygiene.

## Creating a new alias

Click **+ New** in the list view. The editor opens on a blank entry with a **Storage** field pill at the top — that's the tier picker. Pick **Project** to commit the alias to the repo, or **User** to keep it on your machine only.

![The New Model editor with the Storage tier picker open — Project (selected) or User — and the alias / id / env / pricing / Applied-by sections beneath.](/screenshots/models/05-new-entry-tier-picker.png)

The editor has four sections:

| Section | What it controls | Where it's stored |
|---|---|---|
| **Model id** | The full Claude model id (`claude-opus-4-7`) or any identifier your alt-endpoint accepts. | `settings.json` (committed) |
| **Environment variables** | Variables merged into every agent subprocess that runs this alias. | `settings.local.json` (gitignored — safe for secrets) |
| **Pricing** | Per-token rates for cost accounting. | `settings.json` under `worca.pricing.models.<alias>` |
| **Applied by** | Templates that reference this alias. Read-only — informational. | derived |

![The Model Editor for an alias routed through an alt-endpoint — alias `glm-ds`, id `opus`, eight env vars including `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` pointing at the alternate endpoint.](/screenshots/models/02-editor.png)

Reserved env keys (`WORCA_*`, `PATH`, `CLAUDECODE`) are silently dropped on save — they belong to the pipeline runtime, not to a model profile.

## Editing an alias

Click any project or user card and the editor opens with current values pre-filled. **Save** writes to the alias's files and stays on the page. The card-level **Duplicate** and **Delete** actions are also available from inside the editor's action row.

The same editor surfaces in read-only **View** mode for **built-in** aliases. To customize a built-in (`opus`, `sonnet`, or `haiku`), duplicate it to your project or user tier and edit the copy — the built-ins are force-synced on every `worca init --upgrade`, so editing them directly never sticks.

### Pricing — co-located, not separate

Each model card has its own **Pricing** accordion in the editor. The badges describe the cost source:

- **explicit** — you've set ≥1 per-token rate; worca uses your value.
- **Claude CLI** (neutral) — default endpoint + no rates → worca trusts the number the Claude CLI returns.
- **no badge** — alt-endpoint + no rates; the card's alt-endpoint badge flags the missing-pricing risk.

The **Clear pricing** button (visible when ≥1 rate is set) wipes all four fields and removes the `worca.pricing.models.<alias>` entry on save. Project-wide pricing — currency, budget — lives under **Project Settings → Costs & Budgets**.

## Imported aliases — provenance badge

Aliases that arrived via `worca templates import` carry an `_imported_from: "<bundle-name>"` marker. The list view surfaces this as an **Imported · *bundle*** badge on the card and a banner in the editor. The badge drops on the first UI save — that's the ownership-transfer signal: once you've touched it, it's yours.

If any imported env value is still `<YOUR-SECRET-HERE>`, the card shows a danger **Not configured** badge and the value cell is outlined in red inside the editor. Saving stays enabled (placeholders are valid JSON), but the visual signal is unmistakable.

## Per-agent dropdown — tier-aware

In the Pipeline Templates editor, the per-agent **Model** dropdown shows every alias known across all three tiers — grouped by `PROJECT`, `USER`, and `BUILT-IN` section headers — with a small jump arrow (↗) that opens the alias in the Models page editor.

![The Pipeline Templates editor's per-agent Model dropdown open, showing PROJECT and BUILT-IN section headers and the small ↗ jump-to-Models link next to each agent's model field.](/screenshots/agents-and-models/01-panel.png)

Aliases that aren't defined locally (e.g. a user-tier alias on a different machine) still appear in the dropdown so a template that references them stays editable. The template's runtime resolution always uses whatever is on disk at run start, so an undefined alias surfaces as a clear error rather than a silent fallback.
