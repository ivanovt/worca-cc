The pipeline's nine stages are described in [The pipeline & stages](/concepts/the-pipeline-and-stages/). **Every stage except Preflight has an on/off toggle.**

Stage enable/disable lives inside **Pipeline Templates**, not Project Settings — every run uses an active template, and the template decides which stages run. To change the stage set: open **Pipeline Templates**, edit your active template, and use the **Pipeline** tab.

## Off by default

Two stages ship **disabled** — turn them on for extra rigor:

| Stage | Turn it on when |
|---|---|
| **Plan Review** | You want a second agent to audit the plan for gaps before any code is written. Adds a Planner → Plan Reviewer loop. |
| **Learn** | You want a post-run retrospective with ranked, copyable suggestions after the PR. |

## On by default — but a template can switch them off

The other stages start enabled, but **"on by default" doesn't mean "always runs"** — the active template decides. Several built-ins disable stages to match their kind of work:

| Template | Stage set |
|---|---|
| **quick-fix** | Plan → Implement only — **no Test, Review, or PR** (the change is left on the branch). |
| **investigate** | Plan → PR, to publish a report — **no Coordinate, Implement, Test, or Review** (and Plan Review on). |
| **feature / refactor** | The full pipeline, with Plan Review and Learn enabled. |

So whether Test, Review, or PR runs depends on the template you launch with. See [Pipeline templates](/concepts/pipeline-templates/).

## Preflight checks

**Preflight** is the one stage without a simple agent toggle — it's a script-based stage that validates the environment before any tokens are spent (git state, dependencies, configuration). Preflight is a cross-template carve-out: it lives in **Project Settings → Pipeline → Preflight** and applies regardless of the active template, so you can relax a check that doesn't fit your project without touching every template.
