description: How model aliases, pipeline base config, and named templates merge at run launch — and which layer wins.

worca's runtime configuration is assembled from three independent "things," each with its own merge story, that come together when you launch a run:

1. **Model aliases** (`worca.models`) — shorthand names like `opus` / `sonnet` mapped to full model IDs, plus optional per-model environment for alt-endpoint routing.
2. **Pipeline base config** (`worca.stages`, `worca.agents`, `worca.loops`, `worca.circuit_breaker`, `worca.effort`, …) — the values that govern how a run executes.
3. **Named templates** — `feature`, `quick-fix`, `bugfix`, … — pre-baked pipeline-config bundles you select at launch.

The matrix below shows every layer that contributes, where it lives on disk, and how it merges. **Bottom rows win.**

## The matrix

| Layer | Where it lives | Models (`worca.models`) | Pipeline base config | Named templates |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Built-in templates | shipped in worca | — | — | `feature`, `quick-fix`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, … |
| **User settings** | `~/.worca/settings.json` (+ `.local.json`) | deep-merge per alias | **selective only** — see below | — |
| **User templates** | `~/.worca/templates/<id>/template.json` | — | — | **shadows** built-in by id |
| **Project settings** | `.claude/settings.json` (+ `.local.json`) | deep-merge per alias, wins over user | the pipeline base — **with template-owned keys stripped when a template is in play**; see below | — |
| **Project templates** | `.claude/templates/<id>/template.json` | — | — | **shadows** user + built-in by id (project > user > built-in) |
| Selected template at run launch | `--template` arg, `POST /runs` body, or `worca.default_template` fallback | rarely sets; overlays on top if it does | deep-merge over the stripped project base — wins on every template-owned key | (this row *is* the chosen template's body) |
| Run-specific overrides | CLI flags / `POST /runs` body | — | for the specific keys each flag targets | — |

### Legend

- **deep-merge** (models, pipeline config): per-key merge. A higher row overrides only the keys it sets; keys it doesn't mention pass through from below. Template configs additionally support a `__replace__: true` flag that forces wholesale replacement of a key instead of recursive merge.
- **shadow** (templates): first match by id wins; tiers do not merge. A project `feature` template *replaces* the built-in `feature` entirely.
- **selective** (user settings → pipeline base): see "What user settings actually contribute" below — only a fixed handful of keys, not a full cascade.
- **—** : this layer doesn't contribute to that column.

## Template-driven keys

When a template is in play at run launch (explicit `--template`, `POST /runs` body, or `worca.default_template` fallback), these keys are **stripped from the project-settings merge base** before the template's config applies. The selected template owns them outright; project Settings values for these keys are silently ignored for that run:

- `worca.agents`
- `worca.stages`
- `worca.loops`
- `worca.circuit_breaker`
- `worca.effort`
- `worca.governance.dispatch`

Everything else under `worca.*` — `worca.models`, `worca.webhooks`, `worca.pricing`, `worca.governance.guards`, `worca.graphify`, `worca.code_review_graph`, `worca.default_template` itself, and preflight check definitions — is **cross-template**: kept in the merge base regardless of which template is selected. These are project-machine concerns (creds, infra, integrations) that should be the same for every template the project runs.

If no template is in play (no `--template`, no body, no `default_template`), no stripping happens — project Settings values apply as written.

## How the three columns come together at run launch

1. Load project `.claude/settings.json` (+ `.local.json`) as the pipeline base.
2. Build the final `worca.models` dict by deep-merging user → project entries.
3. For the specific user keys listed below, pull them from `~/.worca/settings.json` and merge under the project base.
4. Resolve the template id: prefer the explicit `--template` / `POST /runs` body; otherwise fall back to `worca.default_template`. Then walk project → user → built-in; first match wins.
5. **If a template is in play, strip the template-owned keys from the pipeline base.** Deep-merge the template's `config` over the stripped base.
6. Apply CLI / API overrides for the specific keys each flag targets.
7. Resolve each agent's `model:` alias against step 2's `worca.models`.

## What user settings actually contribute

:::caution[Most user-settings keys are silently ignored by the pipeline]
The user file (`~/.worca/settings.json`) is **not** a full cascade base for the project file. Only a fixed handful of keys are read by the orchestrator. If you put `worca.agents.implementer.model = "sonnet"` in your user file, **it has no effect** — the pipeline never reads it on that code path. Put per-agent overrides in **project** settings.
:::

| Where user settings contributes | Keys |
|---|---|
| Model alias dict (`worca.models`) | every alias, deep-merged with project winning on collision |
| Explicit global-only keys (consulted via `load_global_settings()`) | `circuit_breaker.classifier_model`, `parallel.cleanup_policy`, `parallel.max_concurrent_pipelines`, `ui.worktree_disk_warning_bytes` |

`worca init --upgrade` surfaces a migration warning if it finds any of these global-only keys sitting in a project file.

## Key gotchas

:::caution[A selected template wipes project Settings for template-owned keys]
If your project sets `loops.implement_test: 3` and you launch with the `quick-fix` template, you get whatever `quick-fix` sets (or the code default if it doesn't set it) — **not 3**. Template-owned keys are *stripped* from the project base before the template applies, so Settings can't leak in on the keys the template doesn't explicitly touch. Cross-template keys (models, webhooks, etc.) survive untouched.
:::

- **`worca.default_template` pins a project's pipeline.** Set it once and every run uses that template unless `--template` overrides at launch. `worca init --upgrade` auto-migrates customized template-owned keys into a `_legacy-settings` template and pins it as your default, so existing projects don't see a behavior change until they explicitly opt in by editing or replacing it.
- **Templates never merge across tiers.** Project shadows user shadows built-in by id. To extend a built-in template, copy it into your project (or user) scope and edit there — don't expect partial overrides. The [`/worca-template`](/advanced/authoring-templates/) skill automates this.
- **Models have only two real tiers in the visible dict** (user, project). `opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku` only have a silent code fallback — to customize their `env` block (alt-endpoint routing), list them explicitly in user or project settings so they appear in **Settings → Models**.
- **`.local.json` deep-merges into its sibling `.json`** at load time, per tier. That's how the [secrets split](/configuration/secrets/) keeps committed `id` values separate from gitignored `env` blocks while presenting a unified `worca.models` to the rest of the pipeline.
- **CLI/API overrides aren't a free-form layer.** Each flag targets specific keys (`--mloops` → `loops.*`, `--msize` → effort sizing, `--template` → template id, `--param` → template params).
