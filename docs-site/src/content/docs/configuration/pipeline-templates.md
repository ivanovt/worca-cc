The **Pipeline Templates** page lives under **Project Configuration** in the sidebar, next to **Project Settings**. From it you can browse every template across all three tiers (built-in, user, project), create new ones with a structured editor, duplicate built-ins as a starting point, and set a project default — without touching the CLI or editing JSON by hand.

:::note[Project-scoped]
Both **Project Settings** and **Pipeline Templates** are hidden in global all-projects mode until you select a project. Pick a project in the sidebar (or launch worca-ui with `--project /path`) and the **Project Configuration** section appears.

## Opening the editor

Click **Pipeline Templates** in the sidebar. You get three collapsible tier sections:

| Section | Default state | Contains |
|---|---|---|
| **Project** | Open | Templates defined in `.claude/templates/` — committed, shared with the team. |
| **User** | Collapsed | Templates defined in `~/.worca/templates/` — available across all your projects. |
| **Built-in** | Collapsed | Templates shipped with worca (`feature`, `feature-fast`, `feature-minor`, `bugfix`, `quick-fix`, `refactor`, `investigate`, `test-only`). Read-only — you can duplicate, export, or view them, but not edit them in place. |

Each section header shows a count badge. The card for the current project default is marked with a **★ Default** badge.

**Cards are clickable.** Clicking anywhere on a card opens the editor — in **edit** mode for project and user templates, in read-only **View Template** mode for built-ins.

## Template tiers and shadowing

Templates resolve by id — project beats user beats built-in, with no cross-tier merging. If you create a project template with the same id as a built-in (`feature`, say), the project template **replaces** the built-in for that project. The list shows all three tiers separately so you can see what exists where; the resolution rule is what matters at run launch.

For the full merge story — how templates interact with project settings, model aliases, and CLI overrides — see [Configuration precedence](/configuration/precedence/).

## Creating a template

Click **New template** in the list view. You're asked for a scope (project or user) and an id; the editor then opens on the new template.

Templates have one of two starting points:

- **From scratch** — the new editor opens with empty defaults. Fill in only the keys you want to override; everything else falls through to worca's code defaults.
- **From a built-in** — click **Duplicate** on any built-in card and pick a destination scope + id. The copy carries the built-in's values as a starting point.

:::tip[Start from a built-in]
Most custom templates begin as a duplicate of `feature`, `bugfix`, or `quick-fix`. You inherit a known-good shape and only diverge on the keys you actually care about.
:::

## The editor

The editor is organized as a top subheader (template-level metadata) and three tabs.

### Top subheader

A row of "field pills" carrying the template's metadata:

- **Name** — the human-readable label shown on cards and in the run launcher.
- **ID** — the slug you reference at launch (`--template <id>` or `worca.default_template`). Underscores are allowed. If the id collides with another template in the same tier, an inline **yellow warning badge** appears next to the field with a tooltip explaining the collision; **Save** is disabled until you resolve it.
- **Storage** — a read-only badge showing the tier (**Project** / **User** / **Built-in**).
- **★ Default toggle** — flips this template as the project default. Mirrored on the card-level **Set as default** action.
- **Description** — a longer free-text field that appears below the name on cards and as a tooltip in the launcher.

![The editor subheader: Name / ID / Storage field pills with the inline ID-collision warning visible next to the ID field.](/screenshots/pipeline-templates/03-editor-subheader.png)

### Tabs

| Tab | What it controls | Maps to |
|---|---|---|
| **Agents** | Per-agent **model**, **max turns**, **effort**, and (Coordinator only) **max beads**; pipeline-level **auto mode** and **auto cap** for adaptive effort escalation. The Model dropdown lists every alias across Project / User / Built-in tiers with a tier section header and a ↗ jump-to-Models link. The Effort field carries an advisory yellow chip when set below the [recommended floor](/configuration/agents-and-models/#advisory-min-effort-indicators) for that role. | `worca.agents.*`, `worca.effort` |
| **Pipeline** | Per-stage on/off toggles and agent picker; **approval gates** (plan / PR); **[CLAUDE.md load mode](/configuration/claude-md-mode/)**; **retry loops** (implement/test, review, plan-review); **circuit breaker** (enable + max consecutive failures). | `worca.stages`, `worca.claude_md_mode`, `worca.loops`, `worca.circuit_breaker`, `worca.milestones` |
| **Governance** | Per-agent allowlists for **tools**, **skills**, and **subagents**. | `worca.governance.dispatch` |
| **Overlays** | Read-only view of the prompt overlay files (`agents/*.md`) attached to this template, grouped by stage with sub-tabs for agent prompt and user prompt. Visible only when at least one overlay file is present. Overlays arrive via import, duplicate, or a filesystem drop — the tab surfaces them regardless of origin. | `agents/` directory |

The editor only writes the delta — keys you leave blank inherit defaults, keeping templates lean and upgrade-friendly. It runs the same deep-merge simulation the pipeline uses at launch, so malformed config is caught before it hits disk.

![Three editor tabs side by side — Agents (model / turns / effort per agent), Pipeline (stage toggles + loops + circuit breaker), Governance (dispatch allowlists).](/screenshots/pipeline-templates/04-editor-tabs.png)

## Editing a template

Click any project or user template card and the editor opens with current values pre-filled. **Save** writes to the template's file and stays on the page with a transient "Saved" toast — useful for tuning across multiple tabs in one sitting. **Export** downloads the template as a bundle.

### Read-only built-in templates

Clicking a **built-in** card opens the editor in **View Template** mode: every field is read-only, the **Save** button is replaced by **Close**, and the only available actions are **Duplicate** and **Export**. To customize a built-in, duplicate it to your project or user scope and edit the copy.

![The editor in View Template mode for a built-in: subheader pills disabled, no Save button, Close + Duplicate + Export as the only actions.](/screenshots/pipeline-templates/05-view-mode.png)

## Duplicating a template

Click **Duplicate** on any card — or from inside the editor — to copy the template under a new id. You're asked for a destination scope (project or user) and the new id; the copy is independent of the original. **Duplicate is available on every tier**, including built-ins (the canonical "customize a built-in" entry point).

You can also duplicate a built-in to the **same** id in project or user scope — that's the canonical **shadow flow**: the built-in keeps existing but is replaced by your copy when worca resolves the id at run launch.

## Setting a project default

Either flip the **★ Default** toggle inside the editor, or click **Set as default** on a card. This writes `worca.default_template` in your project's `.claude/settings.json` (as a `{ tier, id }` object — not a bare string), so every run uses that template unless you override with `--template` at launch.

The toggle is available on **Project** and **Built-in** cards alike — built-ins ship with the worca-cc package, so pinning one as your project default is fully portable across collaborators. Only **User**-tier templates (which live in your `~/.worca/templates/` and never travel with the repo) are excluded.

The **★ Default** badge moves to the newly selected card. To clear the default (so runs use raw project settings with no template), use **Clear default** or remove the `worca.default_template` key from Settings.

:::tip[Renaming a default template]
Renaming a template that is set as the project default automatically updates the `worca.default_template` pointer to the new name — no manual reset needed. The ★ Default badge follows the rename in the list view.
:::

:::caution[Template-owned keys are stripped when a default is set]
Once a default template is in play, project settings for `agents`, `stages`, `loops`, `circuit_breaker`, `effort`, and `governance.dispatch` are stripped from the merge base — the template owns those keys outright. Cross-template keys (models, webhooks, pricing, etc.) are unaffected. See [Template-driven keys](/configuration/precedence/#template-driven-keys).
:::

## Exporting and importing

- **Export** — click **Export** on any card (or inside the editor). The format is chosen automatically: `.zip` when the template has prompt overlay files (`agents/*.md`), `.json` for config-only templates. Secrets are redacted in either format, safe to share or commit. Export works on every tier, including built-ins.
- **Import** — click **Import** in the list view to upload a `.json` or `.zip` bundle file. The UI runs a **preview pass** first and, if any collisions are detected, opens a dialog with two sections so you can decide what to do:
  - **Template collisions** — for each template id that already exists in the target scope, pick **Replace** (overwrite) or **Skip** (keep the existing).
  - **Model alias collisions** — for each model alias in the bundle that already exists in the target scope (project or user), pick **Rename** (zero-padded `-NN` suffix; the imported template's `config.agents.*.model` references are rewritten transactionally), **Overwrite** (replace the existing definition), or **Skip** (keep the existing).

  Click **Import** in the dialog footer to commit. The post-import view lists the templates that landed and any overlay files that came in. Imported aliases carry an `Imported · <bundle-name>` provenance badge on the Models page that drops on the first UI save.

![The import dialog after preview detects both kinds of collisions: a yellow "Template collisions" section showing feature-glm-ds → Replace, and a yellow "Model alias collisions" section showing glm-ds → Rename glm-ds-01, with "1 new alias will land cleanly: sonnet" below.](/screenshots/import-bundle/01-collision-dialog-templates.png)

:::note[Gist sharing — JSON bundles only]
The "Copy gist URL" action is available only on templates without prompt overlays. Templates with overlays must be shared as a downloaded `.zip` file attachment.
:::

## In-flight run guards

Deleting a project or user template that is currently used by running pipelines shows a confirmation dialog with the count of in-flight runs. Templates resolve at run start, so existing runs aren't affected by the delete — the guard just makes the relationship visible before you commit.

Built-in templates can't be deleted; that action is hidden on built-in cards.

## When the worca-cc CLI is missing or too old

The Pipeline Templates page delegates CRUD operations to the `worca` Python CLI. If the CLI isn't installed — or is older than the version the UI requires — a **degraded-mode banner** appears at the top of the page:

> **Editing is disabled** — this UI needs worca-cc *X.Y* or later.

In degraded mode, **Create**, **Edit**, **Duplicate**, **Delete**, and **Import** are disabled across all cards. **Export** still works, because it's a read-only operation against the bundles on disk. Install or upgrade `worca-cc` to restore full editing.

:::note[Screenshot — coming soon]
