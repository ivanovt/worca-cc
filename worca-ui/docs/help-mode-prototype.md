# Help-mode prototype (W-061 alternative)

**Branch:** `prototype/W-061-help-mode-toggle`
**Status:** Prototype — for design evaluation, not for merge.
**Replaces:** the always-on inline `?` icon approach in `docs/plans/W-061-in-app-help-links.md`.

## What it does

A persistent **right-edge "Help" tab** (rotated label + `?` kbd hint) and the
**`?` keyboard shortcut** both toggle "help mode." When help mode is on, every
UI surface that registered a `helpFor(id)` call reveals a glowing primary-coloured
badge anchored to its top-right corner. Click the badge → opens the relevant
`docs.worca.dev` page in a new tab. `Escape` closes help mode.

When help mode is off, the UI is unchanged — zero baseline visual noise.

## Why prototype this instead of the inline-icon plan

The original W-061 plan placed ~22 always-on `?` icons across the UI (now
closer to ~30 after W-062 + W-063). That's defensible but visually heavy in
dense ops panels (dispatch governance, run-detail). This prototype tests
whether an opt-in reveal pattern works better.

Trade-off awareness (see also `.worca/analyses/issue-259.md`):
- **Win**: zero baseline noise; single discoverable affordance.
- **Loss**: two-click cost per lookup (toggle, then click); right-edge tabs
  carry "chat widget" association in users' muscle memory.
- **Novel**: this pattern is uncommon for ongoing docs discovery (it's the
  norm for one-shot product tours via Pendo/Appcues, less so for reference).

## Architecture

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `app/utils/help-links.js` | Frozen `HELP_LINKS` registry (helpId → `{slug, title}`), `helpUrl(id)`, `helpFor(id)` lit-html template. |
| `app/utils/help-mode.js` | `isActive()` / `setActive()` / `toggle()` / `subscribe()`. Owns `body.help-mode-active`. Binds `?` and `Escape` globally with an input-focus guard. |
| `app/views/help-edge-tab.js` | The right-edge tab. Re-renders only when help-mode state flips (subscribed via `help-mode.subscribe`). Lives in its own fixed-position root outside the lit-html app, so route changes don't unmount it. |
| `app/styles.css` (appended block) | `.help-edge-tab` (rotated label, hover, active state), `.help-badge` (hidden until `body.help-mode-active`, absolute top-right of parent, glow pulse, `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback to static highlight), dark-mode tokens. |
| `app/main.js` | Bootstrap: mount the edge tab into `<div id="help-edge-tab-root">` appended to `<body>`, bind keyboard. |

## Instrumented surfaces — full UI sweep

After the initial 16-surface validation pass, the prototype was extended to cover every primary teaching surface across the UI. Total: **34 surfaces** across 14 view files, all mapping to existing pages under `docs-site/src/content/docs/`. The "one `?` per primary teaching surface" discipline rule still holds — no per-button / per-field placements.

### Surfaces deliberately uninstrumented

- `beads-panel.js`, `token-costs.js`, `learnings-panel.js`, `live-output.js`, `log-viewer.js` — no dedicated doc page yet; the skip-if-no-doc rule prevents `?` icons that would link to 404s or thin pages.
- `settings-graphify.js`, `settings-code-review-graph.js` — covered transitively via the parent settings tabs.
- `dispatch-section.js`, `stage-timeline.js` — covered transitively via `run-detail.js`.
- `add-project-dialog.js` — dialog; help-mode activation is unlikely while modal-focused. Available as `add-project` helpId if desired later.
- `dag-graph.js`, `fleet-card.js`, `run-card.js`, `workspace-card.js`, `run-list.js`, `group-rendering.js`, `agent-names.js`, `dispatch-tag-state.js`, `launcher-shared.js`, `stage-tab-memory.js` — utility / card / shared components; not primary teaching surfaces.

### Registry coverage

All 34 placements map to entries already in `HELP_LINKS` (the registry was sized for ~25 ids during the initial prototype; the full UI sweep added zero new entries). Doc pages currently in the tree but unused by any UI surface (preserved in the registry for future use): `effort`, `secrets`, `controlling`, `first-run`, `events`. Doc pages not in the registry but available as future targets: adding-models, anatomy-of-an-agent-prompt (already used), authoring-templates (already used), overriding-agent-prompts, running-from-the-cli, guides, agents-models-and-effort, fleet-and-workspace-runs, installation, prerequisites, the four introduction/* pages, the four reference/* pages, and upgrading/upgrading.

## How to evaluate

1. `cd worca-ui && pnpm worca:ui:restart` (or `npm run build && pnpm worca:ui:restart`).
2. Look for the vertical **"Help (?)"** tab on the right edge of the viewport. It should be muted-neutral idle, primary when active.
3. Press `?` (Shift+/ on US keyboards) or click the edge tab.
4. Navigate to Settings → Pipeline Templates and watch every instrumented tab reveal a glowing badge in its top-right corner.
5. Open a run → Run Detail. Every panel header listed above should sprout a badge.
6. Click any badge → opens `docs.worca.dev/<slug>/` in a new tab.
7. Press `Escape` or click the edge tab again to close.
8. Test reduced-motion: enable "Reduce motion" in macOS System Settings → Accessibility → Display. Reload. Help mode should still reveal badges but with no pulse animation.

## Known limitations / things to evaluate

- **`:has()` selector dependency.** The CSS uses `body.help-mode-active *:has(> .help-badge)` to auto-`position: relative` any direct parent of a badge. Supported in Chrome 105+, Safari 15.4+, Firefox 121+. Older browsers will see the badge mis-position to the nearest positioned ancestor (degraded but not broken).
- **sl-tab badge placement.** Inside sl-tab label slots, the badge is nudged outward (`top: -6px; right: -6px`) so it sits at the tab's corner rather than overlapping the label text. Visually evaluate this on Settings tabs — it may need further tuning per Shoelace version.
- **No tests.** This is a prototype; if the pattern survives evaluation, write `help-links.test.js` (L1 source-resolution), `help-mode.test.js` (state machine + keyboard), and `e2e/help-mode.spec.js` (toggle → reveal → click).
- **No L2 release check.** The `scripts/check-help-links-live.py` from the original plan is unimplemented in this prototype.
- **No build-time `WORCA_DOCS_BASE` override.** The original plan's esbuild `define` is also unimplemented; the registry defaults to production docs.
- **Not all surfaces instrumented.** Launchers, dashboard, sidebar, Pipeline Templates page, and Run Timeline header are deliberately uncovered so they don't dilute the evaluation. The pattern works regardless; fan-out is mechanical.

## Decision points for "should we merge this approach"

After clicking through, the question to answer is:

> Is the **opt-in reveal** discoverable enough for new users, given that the edge tab is the only persistent affordance? Or do users actually want the always-on inline `?` from the original plan, density cost included?

If opt-in survives, the follow-ups are: (1) instrument remaining surfaces, (2) write the test suite, (3) implement L1 + L2 sync checks, (4) reconcile with the W-061 plan file.

If opt-in does not survive, fall back to the inline-icon plan but apply the **coarser placement discipline** (Option A from the analysis): one `?` per route/section rather than per panel, dropping the inventory from ~30 to ~12.
