# W-005: Agent Memory & Context Sharing


**Goal:** Give every pipeline stage a durable, human-readable view of accumulated decisions, rationale, failures, and artifacts from all prior stages. Loop-backs (test failure → implement retry, review changes → implement retry) automatically inject the failure context so the retrying agent understands exactly what went wrong and why. Crucially, the context survives pause/resume — a resumed pipeline picks up the full history without loss.

**Architecture:** A new `ContextManager` class owns one Markdown file per run at `.worca/runs/{run_id}/context.md`. This file is the **primary and sole vehicle** for accumulated cross-stage context. The `runner.py` creates the file at run start, passes a `ContextManager` instance through the pipeline loop, and calls `append_stage_entry()` after each stage completes. `PromptBuilder` reads the file via `ContextManager.build_prompt_section()` and injects a `## Shared Run Context` section into every agent prompt. On resume, `PromptBuilder` starts with an empty `_context` dict, but the context file on disk preserves the full run history — this is the key advantage over in-memory accumulation.

**Design decision — file as primary context source:** The existing `prompt_builder._context` dict accumulates stage results in memory, but this state is lost on pause/resume (a fresh `PromptBuilder` is created). Rather than serializing the dict to disk (reinventing the file with worse readability) or reconstructing from `status.json` (which lacks rationale, decisions, and failure details), the context file serves as both the persistence layer and the richer accumulator. Agents receive context exclusively via `PromptBuilder`'s prompt injection — they do not read the file directly via tool calls. The `{context_file}` template variable in agent `.md` files is removed; agents rely on the `## Shared Run Context` section that `PromptBuilder` injects into their prompts.

**Tech Stack:** Python stdlib only (no new dependencies). Markdown for the context file format. Touches `runner.py`, `prompt_builder.py`, and all five agent `.md` files.

**Depends on:** Nothing. This is a standalone enhancement to the existing pipeline.

## 1. Scope and Boundaries

### In scope

- `ContextManager` class in `src/worca/orchestrator/context_manager.py`
- Context file format: `.worca/runs/{run_id}/context.md` (one file per run)
- Runner creates the file on fresh start; on resume, `ContextManager` opens the existing file and `PromptBuilder` reads accumulated history from it — this is the primary mechanism for restoring cross-stage context after pause/resume
- Each pipeline stage appends a structured entry on completion
- Loop-back stages (implement retry on test failure, implement retry on review changes) inject the failure/feedback entry into the prompt
- `PromptBuilder` gains a `set_context_manager()` method and injects a `## Shared Run Context` section into every stage prompt by reading the file via `ContextManager.build_prompt_section()`
- Size limit: context file capped at 16,000 characters; older entries are summarized and compacted when the cap is reached
- Unit tests for `ContextManager`: create, append, inject, compact, resume

### Out of scope

- Cross-run memory (context does not persist between runs)
- Vector embedding or semantic search of past decisions
- UI display of the context file (worca-ui reads status.json only)
- Sharing context between parallel implementers (W-002 is a separate feature)
- Modifying the JSON output schemas (`plan.json`, `implement.json`, etc.)

---

## 2. Context File Format

The context file is a Markdown document with a fixed header and one fenced section per stage completion. This makes it readable by humans and straightforwardly parseable by agents as plain text.

### 2.1 File location

```
.worca/runs/{run_id}/context.md
```

The file is created when `run_pipeline()` sets up the run directory. On resume, the existing file is left intact — `ContextManager` opens it in append mode.

### 2.2 Document structure

```markdown
# Worca Run Context

**Run ID:** 20260310-143022
**Work Request:** Add user authentication
**Branch:** worca/add-user-authentication-4Xp
**Started:** 2026-03-10T14:30:22Z

---

## Stage: plan | 2026-03-10T14:31:05Z | iter 1

**Approach:** Implement JWT-based auth with a /api/auth/login endpoint.
Use the existing Express middleware pattern. No external auth library.

**Key Decisions:**
- Chose JWT over sessions: stateless, fits current API pattern
- Token expiry: 24h access, 7d refresh stored in HttpOnly cookie
- Files to touch: server/auth.js (new), server/app.js (register route)

**Tasks Outline:**
- Create server/auth.js with login, logout, refresh handlers
- Add auth middleware to protected routes in server/app.js
- Add tests: auth.test.js (unit), integration/auth.spec.js

**Artifacts:** docs/plans/20260310-143022-add-user-authentication.md

## Stage: coordinate | 2026-03-10T14:33:12Z | iter 1

**Beads Created:** [bd-001, bd-002, bd-003]
**Dependency Graph:** bd-001 → bd-002 → bd-003

---

## Stage: implement | 2026-03-10T14:45:33Z | iter 1 | trigger: initial

**Files Changed:** server/auth.js, server/app.js, tests/auth.test.js
**Tests Added:** tests/auth.test.js (12 tests)
**Bead Completed:** bd-001 (Create auth module)

---

## Stage: test | 2026-03-10T14:47:02Z | iter 1 | outcome: FAILED

**Result:** FAILED
**Failures:**
- tests/auth.test.js > token refresh > should return 401 on expired token
  Error: jwt.verify is not a function — imported from wrong path
- tests/auth.test.js > login > should hash password before compare
  Error: bcrypt.compare called with undefined salt

---

## Stage: implement | 2026-03-10T14:52:18Z | iter 2 | trigger: test_failure

**Fixes Applied:**
- Corrected jwt import path in server/auth.js (line 3)
- Fixed bcrypt.compare call: now passes hash from DB lookup
**Files Changed:** server/auth.js
**Tests Added:** (none)

---

## Stage: test | 2026-03-10T14:53:44Z | iter 2 | outcome: PASSED

**Result:** PASSED
**Coverage:** 87%
**Proof Artifacts:** .worca/runs/20260310-143022/logs/test/iter-2.log

---
```

### 2.3 Section schema

Each section has a required header line followed by freeform Markdown. The `ContextManager` writes structured content for known fields and ignores unknown ones when reading.

Header format: `## Stage: {stage_name} | {iso_timestamp} | iter {n} [| trigger: {trigger}] [| outcome: {outcome}]`

All fields after the stage name are optional. The `|`-separated format is chosen because it is scannable by a regex without a full Markdown parser.

### 2.4 Size limit and compaction

The context file must not grow so large that injecting it into a prompt consumes a prohibitive fraction of the model's context window. The limit is **16,000 characters** (approximately 4,000 tokens at average English density). This is enforced by `ContextManager.append_stage_entry()` after each write.

When the file would exceed the limit, `ContextManager._compact()` is called:

1. Parse all sections from the file.
2. Keep the file header (run metadata) verbatim.
3. Keep the last **two** sections verbatim (most recent context is highest priority).
4. Replace all earlier sections with a single `## Compacted History` block that lists only the stage name, timestamp, outcome, and one-line summary per section.
5. Rewrite the file.

The compacted format:

```markdown
## Compacted History (earlier stages summarized)

- plan | 2026-03-10T14:31:05Z | outcome: approved | Approach: JWT auth, server/auth.js new
- coordinate | 2026-03-10T14:33:12Z | outcome: success | 3 beads created
- implement | 2026-03-10T14:45:33Z | iter 1 | outcome: success | 3 files changed
- test | 2026-03-10T14:47:02Z | iter 1 | outcome: FAILED | 2 failures in auth.test.js
```

## 3. ContextManager Class

### 3.1 Module location

`.claude/worca/orchestrator/context_manager.py`

### 3.2 Public API

```python
class ContextManager:
    MAX_CHARS = 16_000

    def __init__(self, context_path: str):
        """
        Args:
            context_path: Absolute or relative path to the context.md file.
                          File need not exist yet; create() initialises it.
        """

    def create(self, run_id: str, title: str, branch: str, started_at: str) -> None:
        """Write the file header. Overwrites any existing file.
        Called once at the start of a fresh run."""

    def append_stage_entry(self, stage: str, iteration: int, trigger: str,
                           outcome: str, body: str) -> None:
        """Append a new stage section to the context file.
        Calls _compact() if file size would exceed MAX_CHARS after append."""

    def read_full(self) -> str:
        """Return the full content of the context file, or '' if it does not exist."""

    def build_prompt_section(self, max_chars: int = 4_000) -> str:
        """Return a Markdown section suitable for injection into an agent prompt.
        Truncates to max_chars from the end (most recent content preserved)
        with a leading note if truncated."""

    def _compact(self) -> None:
        """Internal: rewrite file keeping header + last 2 sections verbatim,
        summarising all earlier sections into a Compacted History block."""

    def _parse_sections(self, content: str) -> list[dict]:
        """Internal: parse content into a list of section dicts.
        Each dict: {'header': str, 'body': str, 'stage': str, 'outcome': str}."""
```

### 3.3 Entry body helpers

`runner.py` builds the `body` string for each stage using these conventions. `ContextManager` itself does not know about stage semantics — it accepts any Markdown string.

| Stage | Key body content |
|-------|-----------------|
| plan | Approach, Key Decisions, Tasks Outline, Artifacts (plan file path) |
| coordinate | Beads Created (IDs), Dependency Graph summary |
| implement | Files Changed, Tests Added, Bead Completed, Fixes Applied (if retry) |
| test | Result (PASSED/FAILED), Failures list (name + error), Coverage %, Proof Artifacts |
| review | Outcome, Issues list (file:line severity description) |
| pr | PR URL, Title |

---

## 4. Integration with runner.py

### 4.1 Initialization at run start

After the run directory is created and `status["run_id"]` is set, create the context file:

```python
from worca.orchestrator.context_manager import ContextManager

context_file = os.path.join(run_dir, "context.md")
ctx = ContextManager(context_file)
ctx.create(
    run_id=status["run_id"],
    title=work_request.title,
    branch=branch_name,
    started_at=status["started_at"],
)
```

On resume, skip `ctx.create()` — `ContextManager` will append to the existing file.

```python
if resume_stage:
    ctx = ContextManager(context_file)  # no create() call
else:
    ctx = ContextManager(context_file)
    ctx.create(...)
```

### 4.2 PromptBuilder wiring

After creating `prompt_builder`, call:

```python
prompt_builder.set_context_manager(ctx)
```

This lets `PromptBuilder` inject the current context snapshot into every stage prompt automatically, without `runner.py` needing to thread it manually into each `update_context()` call.

### 4.4 Per-stage context appends

After each stage completes and before advancing `stage_idx`, call `ctx.append_stage_entry()` with the structured body. This must happen **after** `complete_iteration()` and `save_status()` so the context reflects confirmed completion.

**After PLAN completes:**

```python
plan_body_parts = []
approach = result.get("approach", "")
if approach:
    plan_body_parts.append(f"**Approach:** {approach}")
tasks = result.get("tasks_outline", [])
if tasks:
    plan_body_parts.append("**Tasks Outline:**")
    for t in tasks:
        plan_body_parts.append(f"- {t.get('title','')}: {t.get('description','')}")
plan_body_parts.append(f"**Artifacts:** {status['plan_file']}")
ctx.append_stage_entry(
    stage="plan", iteration=iter_num, trigger=trigger,
    outcome="approved" if approved else "rejected",
    body="\n".join(plan_body_parts),
)
```

**After COORDINATE completes:**

```python
beads = result.get("beads_ids", [])
dep_graph = result.get("dependency_graph", {})
coord_body = f"**Beads Created:** {beads}\n**Dependency Graph:** {dep_graph}"
ctx.append_stage_entry(
    stage="coordinate", iteration=iter_num, trigger=trigger,
    outcome="success", body=coord_body,
)
```

**After IMPLEMENT completes:**

```python
files = result.get("files_changed", [])
tests = result.get("tests_added", [])
bead_id = prompt_builder.get_context("assigned_bead_id", "")
impl_parts = [
    f"**Files Changed:** {', '.join(files) if files else 'none'}",
    f"**Tests Added:** {', '.join(tests) if tests else 'none'}",
]
if bead_id:
    impl_parts.append(f"**Bead Completed:** {bead_id}")
if trigger == "test_failure":
    failures = prompt_builder.get_context("test_failures", [])
    if failures:
        impl_parts.append("**Fixes Applied (for test failures):**")
        for f in failures:
            impl_parts.append(f"- {f.get('test_name','?')}: {f.get('error','?')}")
elif trigger == "review_changes":
    issues = prompt_builder.get_context("review_issues", [])
    if issues:
        impl_parts.append("**Fixes Applied (for review feedback):**")
        for i in issues:
            impl_parts.append(f"- [{i.get('severity','?')}] {i.get('file','?')}:{i.get('line','?')} {i.get('description','')}")
ctx.append_stage_entry(
    stage="implement", iteration=iter_num, trigger=trigger,
    outcome="success", body="\n".join(impl_parts),
)
```

**After TEST completes:**

```python
passed = result.get("passed", False)
test_parts = [f"**Result:** {'PASSED' if passed else 'FAILED'}"]
if not passed:
    test_parts.append("**Failures:**")
    for f in result.get("failures", []):
        test_parts.append(f"- {f.get('test_name','?')}\n  Error: {f.get('error','?')}")
cov = result.get("coverage_pct")
if cov is not None:
    test_parts.append(f"**Coverage:** {cov}%")
artifacts = result.get("proof_artifacts", [])
if artifacts:
    test_parts.append(f"**Proof Artifacts:** {', '.join(artifacts)}")
ctx.append_stage_entry(
    stage="test", iteration=iter_num, trigger=trigger,
    outcome="PASSED" if passed else "FAILED",
    body="\n".join(test_parts),
)
```

**After REVIEW completes:**

```python
review_parts = [f"**Outcome:** {outcome}"]
issues = result.get("issues", [])
if issues:
    review_parts.append("**Issues:**")
    for i in issues:
        review_parts.append(f"- [{i.get('severity','?')}] {i.get('file','?')}:{i.get('line','?')} — {i.get('description','')}")
ctx.append_stage_entry(
    stage="review", iteration=iter_num, trigger=trigger,
    outcome=outcome, body="\n".join(review_parts),
)
```

**After PR completes:**

```python
pr_parts = []
pr_url = result.get("pr_url", "")
if pr_url:
    pr_parts.append(f"**PR URL:** {pr_url}")
ctx.append_stage_entry(
    stage="pr", iteration=iter_num, trigger=trigger,
    outcome="success", body="\n".join(pr_parts),
)
```

### 4.5 Loop-back context (the critical path)

The existing `runner.py` already calls `prompt_builder.update_context("test_failures", ...)` before looping back to IMPLEMENT. With W-005, the `test` section has already been appended to `context.md` by the time the implement retry runs. `PromptBuilder._build_implement()` injects the `## Shared Run Context` section (which includes the test failure section verbatim) — the context file is the **primary source** for this information.

The existing `_context["test_failures"]` formatting in `PromptBuilder` continues to work as before for backward compatibility, but the richer context file entry (which includes proof artifact paths, coverage data, and the full error messages as the tester recorded them) provides the complete picture. On resume after a pause, the `_context` dict is empty but the context file preserves the full failure history — this is where the file-based approach pays off.

No changes to the loop-back trigger logic in `runner.py` are required beyond adding the `ctx.append_stage_entry()` calls.

---

## 5. PromptBuilder Changes

### 5.1 New method: `set_context_manager()`

```python
def set_context_manager(self, ctx) -> None:
    """Attach a ContextManager. When set, build() injects context into prompts."""
    self._ctx = ctx
```

Add `self._ctx = None` to `__init__`.

### 5.2 New method: `_context_section()`

```python
def _context_section(self) -> str:
    """Return a ## Shared Run Context section for injection into prompts.
    Returns '' if no ContextManager is attached or context file is empty."""
    if not self._ctx:
        return ""
    snippet = self._ctx.build_prompt_section(max_chars=4_000)
    if not snippet:
        return ""
    return f"## Shared Run Context\n\n{snippet}"
```

### 5.3 Injection into each stage builder

Each `_build_{stage}()` method appends `self._context_section()` to its `parts` list before joining. The section is always appended last so the work-request and structured data appear first (agents read top-to-bottom).

Example diff for `_build_plan`:

```python
def _build_plan(self, iteration: int) -> str:
    parts = [
        "Create a detailed implementation plan ...",
        ...
        self._work_request_section(),
    ]
    if self._claude_md_content:
        parts.append(f"## Project Context (from CLAUDE.md)\n\n{self._claude_md_content}")
    context_section = self._context_section()   # new
    if context_section:                          # new
        parts.append(context_section)            # new
    return "\n\n".join(parts)
```

Apply the same three-line addition to `_build_coordinate`, `_build_implement`, `_build_test`, `_build_review`, and `_build_pr`.

For `_build_plan` specifically, the context file will be empty on the first run (it was just created). On a `restart_planning` loop, the context file will contain all prior stage entries — this is intentional and valuable: the planner can see what the guardian objected to.

---

## 6. Agent Prompt Template Changes

Agents receive context exclusively through `PromptBuilder`'s `## Shared Run Context` prompt injection — they do **not** read the context file directly via tool calls. This avoids the dual-channel problem (stale file reads vs. fresh prompt content) and keeps agent templates simple.

No `{context_file}` template variable is added. No changes to `_render_agent_templates` are needed.

The five agent `.md` files in `src/worca/agents/core/` receive a single addition each: a note in their **Context** section explaining that shared run context is injected into their prompt automatically.

### 6.1 planner.md

Add to the **Context** section:

```markdown
If this is a restart (e.g., after a guardian rejection), your prompt includes a `## Shared Run Context` section with prior stage decisions, rationale, and feedback. Use it to understand what was tried before and why it was rejected.
```

### 6.2 coordinator.md

Add to the **Context** section:

```markdown
Your prompt includes a `## Shared Run Context` section with the planner's approach and key decisions. Use it to inform your task decomposition.
```

### 6.3 implementer.md

Add to the **Context** section:

```markdown
Your prompt includes a `## Shared Run Context` section. On retry iterations, this contains test failure details and review feedback from prior stages — use them to guide your fix.
```

### 6.4 tester.md

Add to the **Context** section:

```markdown
Your prompt includes a `## Shared Run Context` section recording what the implementer changed. Use it to understand which files and tests to focus on.
```

### 6.5 guardian.md

Add to the **Context** section:

```markdown
Your prompt includes a `## Shared Run Context` section with the full pipeline history: plan decisions, implementation details, and test results. Review it before forming a judgment.
```

---

## 7. Implementation Tasks

Tasks are ordered so that each step is independently testable and no task depends on a later one.

---

### Task 1: Create `context_manager.py`

**File:**
- Create: `src/worca/orchestrator/context_manager.py`

Implement the `ContextManager` class with the full public API described in Section 3.

**Implementation details:**

`create(run_id, title, branch, started_at)`:
- Build the header block as shown in Section 2.2.
- Write the file with `open(self._path, 'w')`.

`append_stage_entry(stage, iteration, trigger, outcome, body)`:
- Build the `## Stage: ...` header line.
- Append `\n\n{header}\n\n{body}\n\n---\n` to the file using `open(self._path, 'a')`.
- After appending, check `os.path.getsize(self._path)`. If it exceeds `MAX_CHARS`, call `_compact()`.

`read_full()`:
- `open(self._path)` and return content. Return `''` if `FileNotFoundError`.

`build_prompt_section(max_chars=4_000)`:
- Call `read_full()`.
- If content is empty, return `''`.
- If `len(content) <= max_chars`, return content.
- Otherwise, return the last `max_chars` characters prefixed with:
  `"[Context truncated — showing most recent {max_chars} characters]\n\n"`.

`_compact()`:
- Read the full file.
- Call `_parse_sections(content)` to get a list of section dicts.
- If fewer than 4 sections (header + compacted-history + 2 verbatim), skip compaction — not worth it.
- Build compacted history lines from all sections except the last two.
- Reconstruct the file: header block + compacted history section + last two sections verbatim.
- Write the result back with `open(self._path, 'w')`.

`_parse_sections(content)`:
- Split on `\n---\n`.
- The first chunk is the file header (no `## Stage:` prefix).
- For subsequent chunks, match the `## Stage: {stage} | {ts} | iter {n}` pattern.
- Return a list of dicts: `[{'raw': str, 'stage': str, 'timestamp': str, 'outcome': str}]`.
- Chunks that don't match the stage pattern are treated as the header.

---

### Task 2: Add unit tests for `ContextManager`

**File:**
- Create: `tests/test_context_manager.py`

**Test cases:**

`test_create_writes_header`: Call `create()`, read the file, assert header contains run_id, title, branch.

`test_append_stage_entry_adds_section`: Call `create()`, then `append_stage_entry()`. Read the file. Assert section header is present with correct stage, iteration, outcome.

`test_append_multiple_entries_ordered`: Append plan, coordinate, implement entries. Assert they appear in order in the file.

`test_build_prompt_section_under_limit`: Create a context file under `max_chars`. Assert `build_prompt_section()` returns the full content.

`test_build_prompt_section_truncates`: Create a context file over `max_chars`. Assert `build_prompt_section(max_chars=100)` returns only the last 100 chars plus the truncation prefix.

`test_compact_triggered_on_overflow`: Set `MAX_CHARS` to 500 in the test. Append enough entries to exceed it. Assert the file is smaller than `MAX_CHARS` after the next `append_stage_entry()` call. Assert the `## Compacted History` block is present. Assert the last two sections are verbatim.

`test_compact_preserves_last_two_sections`: After compaction, parse the file. Assert the last two stage headers match the last two entries appended.

`test_read_full_nonexistent_returns_empty`: Call `read_full()` on a non-existent path. Assert returns `''`.

`test_create_overwrites_existing`: Write a file, call `create()` again with a different run_id. Assert the old content is gone.

`test_parse_sections_handles_no_sections`: Call `_parse_sections()` with only the header block. Assert returns empty list (or list with just the header).

All tests use `tmp_path` from pytest fixtures. No mocking needed — `ContextManager` only touches the filesystem.

---

### Task 3: Update `PromptBuilder` to inject context

**File:**
- Modify: `.claude/worca/orchestrator/prompt_builder.py`

**Changes:**

1. Add `self._ctx = None` in `__init__`.

2. Add `set_context_manager(self, ctx) -> None` method (sets `self._ctx`).

3. Add `_context_section(self) -> str` method (calls `self._ctx.build_prompt_section(max_chars=4_000)` if `self._ctx` is set, wraps in `## Shared Run Context` header, returns `''` if empty).

4. In each of the six `_build_{stage}()` methods, append `self._context_section()` to `parts` before the final `return "\n\n".join(parts)`. Use `if context_section: parts.append(context_section)` pattern to avoid empty sections.

---

### Task 4: Add unit tests for `PromptBuilder` context injection

**File:**
- Modify: `tests/test_prompt_builder.py` (extend existing test file)

**Test cases:**

`test_build_plan_without_context_manager`: Existing tests should still pass unchanged — verify `set_context_manager` was not called, `build()` returns no `## Shared Run Context` section.

`test_build_plan_with_empty_context`: Attach a `ContextManager` pointing to a nonexistent file. Assert the built prompt has no `## Shared Run Context` section.

`test_build_plan_with_context`: Create a temp context file with one stage entry. Attach a `ContextManager`. Call `build("plan", 0)`. Assert the prompt contains `## Shared Run Context` and the stage entry text.

`test_build_implement_with_context`: Same but for the implement stage.

`test_build_test_with_context`: Same but for the test stage.

`test_context_section_truncates_large_context`: Create a context file with 10,000 characters. Attach `ContextManager`. Call `build("implement", 0)`. Assert the `## Shared Run Context` section is present but truncated.

---

### Task 5: Wire `ContextManager` into `runner.py`

**File:**
- Modify: `.claude/worca/orchestrator/runner.py`

**Changes — import:**

```python
from worca.orchestrator.context_manager import ContextManager
```

**Changes — initialization block (after run directory creation, before the main loop):**

```python
context_file = os.path.join(run_dir, "context.md")
ctx = ContextManager(context_file)
if not resume_stage:
    ctx.create(
        run_id=status["run_id"],
        title=work_request.title,
        branch=branch_name,
        started_at=status["started_at"],
    )
# else: resume — context.md already exists, ContextManager will append
```

**Changes — PromptBuilder wiring:**

After constructing `prompt_builder`, add:

```python
prompt_builder.set_context_manager(ctx)
```

**Changes — per-stage append calls:**

After each stage's `save_status()` call and before `stage_idx += 1`, add the corresponding `ctx.append_stage_entry()` call using the body-building pattern described in Section 4.4.

This must be placed **after** `complete_iteration()` / `update_stage()` / `save_status()` to ensure the status file is consistent before the context is updated.

For loop-back stages (where `continue` is called instead of `stage_idx += 1`), the `ctx.append_stage_entry()` call must be placed **before** the `continue` statement, since the `stage_idx += 1` at the bottom of the loop is never reached.

**Example placement for TEST failure path:**

```python
# Thread test failures ...
ctx.append_stage_entry(          # new: append before continue
    stage="test", iteration=iter_num, trigger=trigger,
    outcome="FAILED", body="\n".join(test_parts),
)
_next_trigger[Stage.IMPLEMENT.value] = "test_failure"
stage_idx = stage_order.index(Stage.IMPLEMENT)
continue
```

### Task 6: Update agent `.md` templates

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/worca/agents/core/planner.md`
- Modify: `src/worca/agents/core/coordinator.md`
- Modify: `src/worca/agents/core/implementer.md`
- Modify: `src/worca/agents/core/tester.md`
- Modify: `src/worca/agents/core/guardian.md`

Apply the additions described in Section 6 to each file. Agents receive context exclusively through `PromptBuilder`'s `## Shared Run Context` prompt injection — no `{context_file}` template variable, no tool-call-based reading. Each agent's **Context** section gets a note explaining what the injected context contains and when it is present.

No changes to agent **Process** sections are needed — agents do not need to perform any action to receive the context (it is injected into their prompt automatically).

---

### Task 7: Integration test — full pipeline with context file

**File:**
- Create: `tests/test_runner_context.py`

This test runs a trimmed mock pipeline through `run_pipeline()` with all agents mocked to return minimal valid structured outputs. It verifies:

1. The context file is created at the expected path.
2. After the PLAN stage, the context file contains a `## Stage: plan` section.
3. After the COORDINATE stage, the context file contains a `## Stage: coordinate` section.
4. After a simulated TEST failure and IMPLEMENT retry, the context file contains two `## Stage: implement` entries and two `## Stage: test` entries in order.
5. The rendered prompt for the implement retry (iteration > 0) contains `## Shared Run Context`.
6. On resume (`resume=True`), the context file is not overwritten — new entries are appended to the existing content.

**Setup approach:**

- Use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `run_agent` in `runner.py` so no actual Claude CLI calls are made.
- Return minimal valid structured outputs for each stage: `{"approved": True, "approach": "test approach", "tasks_outline": []}` for plan, etc.
- Simulate test failure on first TEST call by returning `{"passed": False, "failures": [{"test_name": "t1", "error": "oops"}]}`, then pass on second.
- Use `tmp_path` (pytest) for all file system paths.

## 9. Rollout Order

Tasks should be implemented in this order. Each task is independently testable before proceeding.

1. **Task 1** (`context_manager.py`) — core class, no dependencies
2. **Task 2** (unit tests for `ContextManager`) — validates Task 1 before any runner changes
3. **Task 3** (`PromptBuilder` changes) — depends on Task 1 (imports `ContextManager` indirectly via duck-typing)
4. **Task 4** (unit tests for `PromptBuilder`) — validates Task 3
5. **Task 5** (`runner.py` wiring) — depends on Tasks 1 and 3
6. **Task 6** (agent `.md` templates) — independent, can run in parallel with Tasks 3-5
7. **Task 7** (integration test) — depends on Tasks 1, 3, 5; run last to confirm everything works together

## 10. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A file `.worca/runs/{run_id}/context.md` is created for every fresh pipeline run.
- [ ] The context file contains one `## Stage: {name}` section per completed stage, in chronological order.
- [ ] The implement retry prompt (iteration > 0, trigger `test_failure`) contains a `## Shared Run Context` section that includes the failed test section from the previous test stage.
- [ ] The implement retry prompt (iteration > 0, trigger `review_changes`) contains a `## Shared Run Context` section that includes the review issues recorded by the guardian.
- [ ] On pipeline resume, the context file is not overwritten; new entries are appended. `PromptBuilder` reads the file on resume and injects the full accumulated history into the next agent's prompt — no context is lost across pause/resume.
- [ ] When the context file exceeds 16,000 characters, it is automatically compacted: the last two sections remain verbatim and earlier sections appear in the `## Compacted History` summary block.
- [ ] `build_prompt_section(max_chars=4_000)` never returns more than 4,000 characters.
- [ ] All five agent `.md` templates document the `## Shared Run Context` prompt injection in their Context section.
- [ ] Agents do **not** read the context file directly — context is delivered exclusively via `PromptBuilder` prompt injection. No `{context_file}` template variable exists.
- [ ] All unit tests in `tests/test_context_manager.py` pass (`pytest tests/test_context_manager.py -v`).
- [ ] All new tests in `tests/test_prompt_builder.py` pass without breaking existing tests.
- [ ] The integration test in `tests/test_runner_context.py` passes end-to-end including the loop-back and resume scenarios.
- [ ] No new Python package dependencies are introduced.
- [ ] The existing `tests/` suite continues to pass with no regressions (`pytest tests/ -v`).
