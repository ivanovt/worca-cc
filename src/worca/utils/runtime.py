      2. parent's settings.local.json (env + secrets)

    complete {id, env} pair before it hits the worktree.

    Why both files: with `.claude/settings.json` git-tracked, `git worktree add`
    materialises HEAD's version — which is stale relative to whatever the user
    just imported / edited in the working tree. Reading only settings.local.json
    leaks env without id when HEAD doesn't carry the new alias yet, producing a
    malformed `{env: ...}` entry that fails normalize_model_entry().

    No-op when:
    - Neither parent file exists.
    - Neither file has worca-namespace runtime keys.

    everything from the project's .claude/ into the worktree with these rules:

    - Skip settings.local.json (machine-specific; never propagate verbatim).
    - `tracked-files-win` for everything *except* the `.claude/worca/`
      runtime subtree: if `git worktree add` already placed a file there,
      keep it (projects may legitimately commit customised agents / hooks /
      skills / settings.json).
    - The `.claude/worca/` subtree is the opposite: it is `worca init`-
      managed runtime scaffolding and MUST match the running worca version.
      It is copied unconditionally, overwriting whatever `git worktree add`
      materialised from HEAD. Without this, a project that git-tracks
      `.claude/` with a stale committed `worca/` shadows the project's
      (working-tree) upgrade — the spawned run_pipeline.py is then a
      different version than the launcher and crashes on unknown flags.
    - Narrow exception to the local-skip rule: a small allowlist of
      worca-namespace runtime keys (webhooks, events, models) is merged from
