"""Checkpoint and resume logic.

Provides functions to find where to resume a pipeline, reconstruct context
from saved stage outputs, and check if a status file supports resumption.

New in W-001 (iteration-level resume):
  - find_last_completed_iteration: last completed iter number within a stage
  - get_resume_iteration: iter N+1 to resume from
  - restore_loop_counters: recover persisted loop_counters from status
  - reconstruct_context: extended to include in_progress stages with
    completed iterations
